## Required Metadata Fields
All blog posts must include the following metadata fields in their YAML frontmatter:

```yaml

template: "landing_post"  # Standard template for all blog posts
title: "SEO-optimized title (5-10 words)"
status: "published"  # or "draft" for unpublished posts
date: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+00:00"  # ISO 8601 format
---
```
