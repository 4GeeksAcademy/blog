Hi Geek! Welcome again, on this blog post we'll be talking about Python, why it is so popular, its libraries and use, top jobs that include Python in their toolbox, the industries and companies with the highest demand for Python programmers, and more! Hope you enjoy it.

Is no secret to any software enthusiast that Python is one of the most in-demand programming languages, but why? We are here to explain all the benefits that mastering Python comes with, and why if you are pursuing a career in technology, you'll most likely have to learn this language.

Python is a very intuitive and easy-to-learn program language, which is one of the reasons it became so popular, but also because is a very versatile programming language.

This is a very powerful insight that points out the fact that more and more people are developing more work using Python.

Now is time to get to know why, here we pointed out 3 main reasons why Python is so popular and in high demand for tech professionals:

1. **Intuitive and user-friendly:** Python is one of the easiest programming languages to adopt even if you don't have a professional background. This language uses significant white space and syntax-friendly aims to give the user better readability and understanding.

According to [365 Data Science](https://365datascience.com/) Python's most popular libraries are:

- Django: software and app development.
- Flask: web application development.
- Pandas: machine learning and data manipulation.
- CherryPy: web development.
- Pygame: game development.
- Tensorflow: machine learning and deep learning.
- Selenium: automation testing.
- PyTorch: machine learning and deep learning.

And last but not least,

3. **Versatile:** Having Python in your toolbox makes you are a strong candidate to become a software engineer, machine learning professional, python developer, game developer, data scientist, data analyst, and more!
