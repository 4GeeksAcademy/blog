If you are someone, who is looking for a career path that combines the passion for technology, innovation and problem solving, then becoming a machine learning engineer is the best choice for you! In today’s digital world, data has become the most precious and valuable resource. Many companies are searching for these professionals as they can help them to make better decisions by extracting the data from their company’s insights. The machine learning engineers can design, develop and implement machine learning algorithms to solve complicated issues. In this article, machine learning engineer career job outlook is briefly discussed. 

## What Is a Machine Learning Engineer?

A machine learning engineer is a professional who has the skills in Programming language, computer science, and statistics. They build and deploy machine learning models that learn from data to make the predictions. Their key role is to implement the algorithms that have the ability to analyze and process data that is of large amount, along with identifying the patterns and make the predictions based on the patterns already discovered. They also optimize these algorithms so that its proficiency and efficiency can be improved. Moreover, they collaborate with other [software developers](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/full-stack-developer/full-stack-developer), data scientists and stakeholders to ensure that the integration of machine learning models is done smoothly into the existing systems.  

## Machine Learning Engineer Job Outlook

There is an increased demand for machine learning engineers and it is expected to continue its growth in the future. The national average salary of a machine learning engineer is $ 112,992 per year in US. It is the highest paid job salary in the tech industry. The outlook of the job is also promising.

## What Does a Machine Learning Engineer Do?

#### 1.	Data cleaning and preparation:
 Data cleaning is the process of identifying and fixing errors, missing out values and other irregularities in the data and the data processing is process of formatting it for the analysis purpose. 
#### 2.	Feature engineering:
Machine learning engineer does the job of feature engineering. It is to select the most relevant features and the variables from the data, which is then used in the model. Featuring engineering transforms the data, make new features and then select the features. It is done through the domain knowledge. 
#### 3.	Model selection and training: 
The machine learning engineers does the selection for suitable algorithm for the data and the issues at hand. This process involves the use of data to train and adjust the parameters of the model. 
#### 4.	Model evaluation and tuning:
They test and evaluate the model’s performance and making required adjustments on a validation dataset so that its accuracy can be improved. They adjust the hyper parameters, modify the features and change the algorithms so that high accuracy can be attained. 
#### 5.	Deployment: 
After testing and evaluation the model, the machine learning engineers integrate it into the production system. 
#### 6.	Maintenance and monitoring: 
After deployment, the machine learning engineers check and monitor its performance and make the required changes. They retrain, update and make necessary changes to improve the performance of the model.  


In conclude, the rapidly increasing demand of machine learning engineers is due to the importance of data in the digital world. The machine learning engineers design, implement and analyze machine learning algorithms to process the large amount of data. They identify patterns, optimize the algorithms and make the predictions. The machine learning engineer’s professional career is very promising and its salary is $112992 every year in US.
