Haven’t we all seen the advent of technology in the past few years? Ranging from AI to Machine Learning, every niche is booming, but let’s not forget about Data Science. Data Science is all about statistics and mathematics, and it’s all about learning advanced analytics, AI, specialized programming, and Machine Learning. 
That’s because it’s all about extracting meaningful insights for the clients and business. So, if you want to dip your toes in this niche, we are talking about [Data Science Bootcamp](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/datascience-machine-learning) by 4Geeks Academy because it’s the most effective and practical learning experience!

## What Is 4Geeks Academy?

This is basically a coding school with an array of campuses in different parts of the world. They have an array of boot camps, and students can choose between full-time and self-paced/part-time courses (they really care about the learners). The bootcamps and courses have exceptional curricula, which is the reason their graduates are now working at eBay, Microsoft, and Facebook (all the tech giants, eh).

While it’s true that they have self-paced courses and bootcamps available, every student still gets a mentor that helps him/her throughout the learning and professional phases (yes, they will help you even after you graduate and land a job that pays $100k). All the bootcamps are intuitive and immersive, which means you will love your learning experience as it’s nothing like strict schools.

## The Data Science Bootcamp Chicago – The Details

Data Science is an exciting field, and it doesn’t make sense to spend four years on a degree, especially when the tech giants have stopped caring about the name of the university on your resume. That’s why the popularity and effectiveness of boot camps are increasing. For this reason, we are talking about the Chicago Data Science boot camp provided by 4Geeks Academy. This boot camp is meant to give you practical exposure to the world of ML, programming, and Data Science. They have an extremely comprehensive curriculum, and the practice activities are based on real-life problems, making it an interactive learning experience for the students. What we love about this boot camp is there are lectures as well as practice exercises because practice makes the man perfect, right? 

They know how to create the coding environment because they have live code environments within your browsers, so you can practice anytime you want (we think it’s the best). Also, if you need help while the mentor is away, you can always watch the self-help tutorials and lectures. To know more about what you can learn in this best Data Science Bootcamp Chicago, we are sharing some points

Data Exploration & Visualization
With this step, you can learn how algorithms can impact data quality as well as the challenges one faces during data acquisition and transformation. In addition, you can learn how to create hypotheses and determine their validity as well.
Predictive Modeling
Solving real-world problems is the ultimate way of learning how data can help you. Having said that, this boot camp will help you learn the application of predictive analytics and creating a solution. In addition, you will be able to learn unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning and see how future data can help with the problem.
Decision Tree Learning
This is all about learning the decision tree algorithms, so you can learn the classifications in depth. In addition, you will learn how a node will be split up while using entropy and indexes. Also, you can learn R, Python, and Azure.
Boosting
This is one of the most powerful techniques out there as it has an iterative process, so you can change the data distribution. 
The students will be able to learn fundamental boosting techniques. In addition, you will learn how to adapt and change the sampling distribution.
Experimentation & Testing
Contrary to other boot camps where you are left to figure out stuff on your own, 4Geeks Academy has added experimentation and testing models as well. 
You will be able to conduct multivariate as well as A/B testing. The best thing is that experimentation and testing are fully online, so everyone has a hands-on experience.
Schedule
When it comes down to the schedule, many students don’t join because they cannot commit full-time. Well, the good time is that there are part-time and full-time options available for students. The full-time option is available for people who like studying daily (three classes a week), and part-time is good if you want to learn after the job time.
Fee

4Geeks Academy has set a different price for the boot camp, depending on if you want to learn full-time or part-time. In addition, the fee is different for every location. However, if you cannot afford the fee, you can have a scholarship but remember that only part-time students can get the scholarship. The best option is the ISA, with which you will start paying the fee when you get a job (yes, you can learn for free). This is a great option for full-time students as they only have to pay a small deposit before starting the bootcamp and then wait for the job before they’ve to start paying again. It seems like they have full trust in their boot camp!

Interview
Now, many people don’t know this, but the students are interviewed before they are allowed to participate in the bootcamp (nope, it’s not about paying the fee only). The interview usually includes a discussion on your education, experience, career ambitions, your passion for coding, and similar stuff.

The Bottom Line
The bottom line is that if you were looking for the best Data Science boot camps in Chicago, we are sure you will love the one by 4Geeks Academy. It’s interactive and promises a real-time learning experience because everyone deserves to enjoy learning, right?
However, this isn’t everything because even after you are graduated, you can get a mentorship (yes, your mentor will always be there), so you can navigate through the coding problems with professional help. 
On top of everything, every student gets employment help, which helps you secure a nice job as they can help with resume-building as well as interviews!
