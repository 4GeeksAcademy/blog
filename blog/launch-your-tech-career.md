 **AI is transforming how software is built, tested, and delivered — changing not just the tools developers use, but the skills they need to succeed.** If you’re looking to break into tech today, you need a learning experience that reflects this new reality.

That’s exactly why 4Geeks Academy created a new **full-time, in-person Software Engineering with AI Bootcamp** in **Miami**. In just 12 weeks, students learn to code smarter, build faster, and launch a career in tech — with real support and a job guarantee included by default.

Whether you’re switching careers, reentering the workforce, or leveling up your skills, this bootcamp combines expert instruction, real-world tools, and a **guaranteed pathway to employment** that makes the investment worth it.

## Why AI-Integrated Skills Matter Now

AI isn’t replacing developers — it’s changing what developers do and how they work. Tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor**, and custom coding assistants are becoming standard in modern workflows, helping teams ship faster, iterate smarter, and solve problems with greater creativity.

In other words, knowing how to **collaborate with AI** is the new must-have skill.

This bootcamp teaches you how to do exactly that. You’ll still learn full-stack development — front end, back end, algorithms, databases — but you’ll also learn how to use AI tools throughout the process to build faster, think bigger, and stay ahead of the curve.

## What You’ll Learn in 12 Weeks

This is a full-time program, running Monday through Friday for 12 intensive weeks. You’ll be fully immersed in a structured, in-person learning environment — with a daily rhythm that keeps you moving and accountable.

Here’s what you’ll cover:

- ✅ **Front-end & back-end development** with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, and more
- ✅ **Version control (Git), APIs, and database management**
- ✅ **Algorithm scripting** and problem-solving approaches used in technical interviews
- ✅ Hands-on experience with **AI-integrated development tools** like Cursor, Windsurf, and GitHub Copilot
- ✅ A two-week **Vibe Coding** module — where you’ll build and ship real apps using AI, from idea to launch
- ✅ Your own **portfolio project**, built and deployed by you, with expert feedback along the way

Throughout the course, you'll develop the technical foundation and creative mindset needed to build real digital solutions — with or without writing every line of code yourself.

## Real Support. Real Outcomes.

This bootcamp is designed to give you the tools, structure, and guidance to grow — as a developer, job-seeker, and in your career — in today’s AI-powered tech industry.

You’ll be supported by a **human + AI learning system** that adapts to you every step of the way:

- ✅ **Unlimited 1:1 coding mentorship** to help you tackle technical challenges and deepen your understanding — even after graduation
- ✅ **24/7 AI feedback through Rigobot**, your personal coding assistant that keeps you moving, practicing, and improving around the clock
- ✅ **Dedicated career coaches** to refine your resume, build your personal brand, practice mock interviews, and keep your job search on track

## What the Job Guarantee Really Means

The **Software Engineering with AI  Bootcamp includes a Job Guarantee by default** — no extra fees, no upgrade required.

Here’s how it works:

If you complete the program, follow the career guidance, and don’t land a qualifying job within **nine months of graduating**, we’ll refund **100% of your tuition**. No fine print. Just real accountability on our end, and real peace of mind on yours.

We offer this because we believe in our teaching model — and in the people we teach.

## How Hyper-Personalized Learning Helps You Grow Faster

We call it **hyper-personalized learning** — because everything is built around *you*.

Our AI coding assistant, **Rigobot**, tracks your progress, identifies your strengths and struggles, and tailors its feedback in real time to help you improve with every session. You’ll also have **unlimited access to human mentors** for live 1:1 support, and learn in **small, in-person classrooms** where instructors can give you the individualized attention you need to move forward with confidence.

This isn’t one-size-fits-all education. It’s the kind of system that helps you **learn smarter, progress faster, and retain more** — so you’re truly ready for what comes next.
