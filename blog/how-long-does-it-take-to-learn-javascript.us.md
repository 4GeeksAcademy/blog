### How do I make sure I learn JavaScript properly?
 
Besides constant practice, it is important to explore your options and find the learning method that best suits your personality and your goals. 

Here is some advice for aspiring developers to facilitate the learning process:

Start with the basics. They’re the foundation for everything else.
Find a mentor. Having someone to guide you can be beneficial to you.
Join a support community. The most popular ones are on GitHub, Slack, MDN, and Stack Overflow.
Practice every day! We know we’ve said this a lot, but this is the only way to keep advancing and to help fixate what you’ve learned.
Follow a tutorial project online. Make sure it is recent as JavaScript evolves fast.
Take a course, either paid or free.
Do not compare yourself to other developers. Some will learn faster, and some will learn slower. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.
Take care of your mental health. It is very easy to get frustrated at the beginning and  that’s normal. Every programmer has gone through it. It is important to rest properly though and to clear your head from time to time, without neglecting your goals.
The fastest and most efficient way to  [become a full stack developer.](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/full-stack-developer/full-stack-developer) is certainly to join a coding bootcamp. They're purposefully designed to teach you the most important skills in the shortest amount of time.
 
### Can I learn JavaScript on my own?
