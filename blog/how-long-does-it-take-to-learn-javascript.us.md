**General guidelines**



* Aim to create an informative, engaging article that has a clear focus.
* Ensure that each section is adequately detailed and well-explained and that they are logically connected.

**Writing Style and Tone:**



* Maintain a clear, direct, professional tone without sounding overly complex or academic.
* Also avoid slang and overly colloquial language or expressions.
* Avoid over-using words that are clearly “Chat-GPT-ish” ( for example: embark, journey, paramount, unlock potential)
* Do not use overly technical language. Write simply so that both beginners and those somewhat familiar with the field can derive value from the article.
* Avoid "fillers" - phrases that don't add meaningful content.
* Integrate the keywords and the backlinks as naturally as possible  into the content, ensuring their content is directly related to what you are writing about. Do not force it.

**Define the target audience and keep them in mind throughout the article: **



* If they’re absolute beginners it's important to briefly explain each technical term when introducing it so that a complete novice can understand what is being discussed.
* If they’re intermediate, make sure you are providing new and interesting information.
