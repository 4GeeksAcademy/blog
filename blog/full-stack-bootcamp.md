## What is a Full Stack Bootcamp?

A [coding bootcamp](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamp) is an intensive course of 6 months long approximately in which the student becomes a Junior developer in a certain discipline without any previous knowledge. Bootcamps are characterized by their intensity, they are very short compared to traditional university training that generally takes several years, most of them are quite expensive and provide comprehensive training with many sides and a lot of not useful theory about development. In general, the concept coding bootcamp applies to courses that belongs to the technology area, for example, web development, block chain or cybersecurity.

Web development (web pages and platforms) is basically divided into 2 large areas or blocks: on the one hand there is the **front end**, which is everything that the user can see on the screen and interact with it, such as colors, images, videos, types of fonts, esthetic design, *UX (User Experience)* and all the structure of the information so that the user feels comfortable browsing the website. On the other hand, there is the **back end**, which is the system running "behind the screen", the user recognition system, the data that is saved in each of the profiles, authentication of names and passwords, the database, etc.

A **Full Stack Bootcamp** or **Full Stack Coding Bootcamp** offers training in both areas, preparing the future developer to solve problems in both one discipline (*front*) and the other (*back*). In this way, the student is trained in an integral way with a complete understanding of the operation and managing of web platforms.


## Curriculum and Course Outlines of Full Stack Bootcamps


A [Full Stack Developer Bootcamp](https://4geeksacademy.com/es/coding-bootcamps/full-stack-part-time) generally does not provide a wide variety of languages ​​and work tools, but instead provides a large enough and very useful *toolbox* that allows the graduate to offer their services for several tech companies or even work in some personal projects, and with time the developer will continue learning new techniques and workflows.

**Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamps** generally varies in some aspects allowing students to pick the study plan that best fits their situation, having in mind job and personal aspects, schedules and possibilities. The modalities are generally the following:

**Online** or **face-to-face**: the big difference lies in the possibility of the student attending a bootcamp from home, compared to physically present in a place. Although each of these modalities has its advantages, there are also certain disadvantages with them that must be considered when investigating the bootcamp that best suits the reality of each future student. Most of bootcamps offer an [online coding bootcamp](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-campus/online-coding-bootcamp) experience, where you can study in almost any country in the world.

**Real time** or **own speed**: like any online course, all the material can already be uploaded and the student must go through the entire curriculum learning all the themes included in, everything at their own speed, times and schedule. There is no face-to-face class that is strictly scheduled, so the student can accommodate the times to their way. Then, at the end of the entire program (including assessments), the student gets graduated. But, there is also the classic modality of live classes (usually Zoom or Google Meet), in which the times of commitments and personal duties must be accommodated to attend classes taught in real time by a teacher "in person". One of the advantages of this modality is that the student has a much more active participation in the class, so that they can comment, ask questions and interact with the teacher and the rest of their classmates in a more natural way. Generally, this modality is more expensive, due to the physical infrastructure that the face-to-face modality needs.

## Skills and Technologies Taught in Full Stack Bootcamps

Since bootcamps are short-term courses, they generally teach the student only 1 or 2 well-learned tools to quickly enter the job market. They generally teach 1 or 2 *frameworks* for front-end development along with all the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and javaScript and for back-end development one language for database management and construction and one language for building code for the management of the information flow between the user and the web server.

At [4Geeks Academy](https://4geeksacademy.com/), for example, students are taught the tools in each area most used and most demanded by companies nowadays, giving students the maximum chance of joining a company at the end of the bootcamp. For the front-end, the future developer is trained with React, a very useful, powerful and demanded tool today, written and worked with javaScript language and for back-end, it offers training with Python language, the most popular programming language today, and using of relational databases (SQL).


## Benefits of Attending a Full Stack Bootcamp

With the tremendous growth of web development that we have experienced for over 15 years, the demand for *front*, *end* and *full stack* developers have grown very strongly. The number of offered jobs by this market is enormous and extends to practically every country in the world.

The great benefit of attending a **full stack bootcamp** is the possibility of participating in this industry and its growth in a very fast way, even allowing those interested to reinvent themselves professionally from their usual work without the need to stop working to attend a university, that is, much cheaper, quickly and easily.

Learning on your own on the Internet is possible, but it is not easy to access an organized learning path and thought by professionals who know how to learn, in what logical order and from what sources of information to be able to absorb and prepare in the best way, responding to what web development companies need today from their workers.

Also, as mentioned above, the contact networks that can be formed in an environment such as a bootcamp are enormous, and it is not possible to form them in *by-your-own* learning, which not only makes you grow personally, but also being able to form friendships, learn from others, meet companies, leaders, and all these are tools that help to find job opportunities after the bootcamp graduation.

Certain bootcamps, such as 4Geeks Academy offer a job search help system for their graduate students called [Geekforce](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/geekforce-career-support). This means that, once graduated, they get in touch with many companies that are looking for developers and helps you to position yourself in a company that meets the expectations and preferences of the recent graduate, and all this at no additional cost, but is part of what the student pays when enrolling in the academy and lasts for life.

In addition to all this, it offers a **lifetime mentoring system**, this means being able to schedule meetings with more experienced people who can help you solve a certain technological problem both for a personal project and for a company in which you are working. This way you have lifetime technical support from knowledgeable people who can help you with any future web development problems you may have, and most likely these problems will appear.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Full Stack Bootcamps

Web development allows a work team to be physically separated and all work together in a very orderly way. Online (or remote) training inserts the student from the beginning in the remote work flow, quickly learning to complement the work of different people in a single project, communication with different tools for work teams and the use of **git** technology, used worldwide for projects of this type. The face-to-face modality does not offer this possibility to the students, but it does have their physical participation, thus being able to have a much more active participation and make contact networks more naturally for possible job options at the moment. After finishing the course, this is due to the contact with professors, classmates, academics and speakers that you will see throughout your training process.
