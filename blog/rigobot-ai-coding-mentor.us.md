# **Rigobot — Your AI Coding Mentor That Feels Like a Friend**

## Why AI Mentorship Beats Guess-and-Check Coding

In a world where AI can write code, learning to code isn’t about memorizing syntax—it’s about understanding *how* to think like a developer. [Rigobot the AI mentor](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/ai-powered-learning/rigobot-ai-mentor), created by the 4Geeks Academy team, isn’t just another chat-bot. It follows you everywhere you are learning (phone, laptop, coding environment, learnpack…), watches every line you write, and gives you real-time, personalized feedback that grows with you. Whether you’re debugging a Python script or building a React app, Rigobot’s got your back—day or night.

Imagine this: you’re working on a JavaScript exercise, and your loop’s not behaving. Instead of hours of frustration, Rigobot highlights the exact line, explains the logic error, and suggests a cleaner approach. It’s like pair-programming with a pro who never gets tired. And the best part? It’s built into every 4Geeks course, so you start learning with Rigobot from day one.

## How Rigobot Works — Step by Step example

1. **Launch a [LearnPack](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/learnpack) exercise** with one click (no setup).
2. **Code like a pro** in VS Code; Rigobot silently watches tests and commits.
3. **Ask for help** via the *Get Feedback* pane ‑ or wait for Rigobot’s proactive nudge.
4. **Instant explanation**: highlights the bug, explains the logic, suggests a fix.
5. **Adaptive learning**: remembers your patterns and tailors advice every session.

You stay in a real developer workflow from day one—no browser sandboxes, no toy editors.
