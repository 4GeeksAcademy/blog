How Long Does It Take To Learn Python?


Python is a coding language that’s taking the world by storm - and the question in everyone’s mind is, “How long does it take to learn Python?”


The short answer is that learning Python can take from a few weeks to a few months, or - especially if you intend to master it may take quite a few years even. It all depends on to what extent you want to learn.


A shorter time frame only works if you’re looking for a basic understanding of the coding language. If you’re aiming to master it, however, you’ll need a little more time, especially with how much the language has evolved in recent years.


So, you can see that the question of “How long to learn Python?” isn’t that simple to answer - but it’s one we’ll do our

 level best to help you figure out! Stick with us to find out, “How fast can I learn Python?” because we’re here to tell you everything you need to know.


How Long Does It Take To Learn Python Programming?


To simplify the steps of how long to learn Python can be divided into a few separate concepts - like learning the fundamentals from scratch, learning enough to be able to get a job, or even thinking about how Python programming fits into the time frame.


And, of course - this is everyone’s favorite - “How fast can I learn Python?” After all, everyone knows Python is useful, and to get ahead of the curve, speed is of the essence.


How Long Does It Take To Learn Python From Scratch?


If you’re fresh on the scene for Python coding or any coding, learning becomes a little more difficult in terms of getting used to the syntax

 and context in which you’re using the language.


While an advantage is that you don’t have to unlearn any coding habits from other languages, a disadvantage is that you’re learning an entirely new language from scratch.


Therefore, the answer to “How long does it take to learn Python from scratch?” is that it can take several months, most of which are just relegated to getting into the habit of coding and the Python syntax, as well as learning how to navigate its libraries, frameworks, and building basic applications.


How Long Does It Take To Learn Python To Get A Job?


The specific type of job you’re looking for matters a lot regarding what level of Python coding you need to be an expert at. While Python has made its name in countless industries, including web development and data science, not every application is as hectic as the others.


For example, entry-level jobs in data analysis

 fields might take as little as a few months of pre-application prep, but higher-level, more advanced positions in fields such as engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, will require a lot of dedication and time - it can require you to have years of experience.


How Fast Can I Learn Python?


Speed is every new learner’s concern, and it’s true that since you’ll want to jump into the practical application of this skill as soon as possible, the fastest you can learn this skill… still depends.


If you’ve got the dedication, the time, the preferred learning method - and all the other factors affecting the learning time, as clarified further in this article - then it might even be as quick as five to six weeks.


But, again, that’s a highly selective answer based on everything going your way and you having a natural affinity to Python (and, likely, previous programming experience in other

 coding languages).


The more likely answer to this is one or two months - but don’t worry, that’s still a decently short amount of time! Before you know it, the time will have passed, and you will have the fundamentals down pat.


Of course, this is only referring to the fundamentals. Mastering a computer language is another ballgame entirely.


A Mastery of Coding Languages - How Long Does It Take To Master Python?


Like the point about learning speedily, mastering the language is also based on several factors, especially dedication, exposure, and learning approaches. Still, it can take anywhere from two to five years of experience, effort, and knowledge even to begin to claim your mastery.


Can I Learn Python By Myself?


Learning without a professional instructor isn’t impossible in this age of online learning, especially with the availability and proliferation of massive amounts of learning content. Plus, you can always reach out to the Python

 learning communities if you end up stuck at any particular place.


Learning on your own may, however, affect how long does it take to learn Python, so you’ll have to take that into account. Still, it’s less expensive, and you can learn at your own pace - and you can try and shorten the time with more dedication and motivation!


Factors Affecting the Learning Time; Or, “How Fast Can I Learn Python?”


We’ve been mentioning the factors that affect how long to master Python, so let’s not hesitate directly talking about them. Here is a list of some of the elements that make up the learning process - and, indeed, speed it up.


Previous Programming Experience


Whether you’ve worked with Javascript or C++, previous knowledge of coding languages plays a huge role in how quickly you’ll pick up Python. After all, coding languages are pretty similar, even if specific syntax and application tend to play

 out differently.


It’s like normally learning a new language - you’ll learn the ones from the same family far easier, especially those with essential similarities.


For example, for an English speaker, Germanic languages like Norwegian (which even has similar words and pronunciation) would be easiest to learn.


Similarly, for coding, having a basic understanding of other coding languages makes Python easier to learn, too.


Learning Method


How you learn Python plays a pretty important role in this as well. You have a few options:


●      Online tutorials


●      Books


●      Video courses


●      In-person/short university courses


Of course, there are other methods as well, but the ones outlined above tend to be the most commonly utilized. Moreover, all options have their own pitfalls and advantages, and they work to different levels of efficiency for different learners - you’ll have to consider which works best for you on your own.


Learning Environment


Where you learn this language tends to impact your attention span,

 which can either reduce or increase the time it’ll take for you to learn.


For example, a classroom setup can offer you the structure and focus more informal environments might not be able to provide. On the other hand, other options might allow you to earn more practical experience, which isn’t as easy with standardized classroom experiences.


Frequency of Practice


Practice, practice, practice.


For any skill in the world, this is pretty much the one concept that reigns the same across industries, people, and even subjects. The more you code in Python and use the syntax, the more you’ll get used to working with it, and the faster you’ll be able to adopt the skills.


Practicing with it for a few hours daily can give you the boost needed to speed up your learning process.


Motivation and Dedication


Lastly, but definitely not least, you’ll need to be dedicated to the language and to learning that language to

 keep up the learning speed throughout the process. After all, if you get bored, you lose your attention span, and you’re unable to give the skill enough time, which in turn leads to being unable to meet the timeline you’ve set out for yourself.


Short story? Keep up the motivation and dedication; you’re golden - speed won’t be an issue.
