# Rigobot: The AI Coding Mentor That Powers 4Geeks Academy Students 24/7

At [**4Geeks Academy**](https://4geeksacademy.com/), we know getting the skills to break into tech can feel daunting—endless bugs, tricky syntax, and the pressure to build job-ready skills fast. That’s why we created **Rigobot**, our AI-powered coding tutor, to guide you every step of the way. Built into our [**LearnPack**](https://www.learnpack.co/) platform, Rigobot is like a mentor who never sleeps, helping you code smarter, learn faster, and land that tech job. Here’s why students love it.

## Rigobot: Your Coding Sidekick

Picture this: it’s 2 a.m., and you’re stuck on a CSS layout that just won’t align. Instead of frustration, you turn to Rigobot, embedded in [**LearnPack**](https://www.learnpack.co/)’s Visual Studio Code interface. As you type, Rigobot scans your code, spots the missing `display: flex`, and explains why it’s breaking, complete with a fix. It’s not just a debugger; it understands your exercise, tracks your progress, and tailors advice to your skill level, whether you’re a beginner or sharpening advanced JavaScript.

Ask Rigobot anything—“Why’s my Python loop crashing?” or “How do I clean up this function?”—and it responds instantly via [**LearnPack**](https://www.learnpack.co/)’s chat pane, referencing your exact code. No waiting, no googling, just clear, context-aware help.

## How It Works

Start an exercise in [**LearnPack**](https://www.learnpack.co/), and Rigobot is ready. You write code in VS Code, follow clear instructions, and run tests in the terminal. If your code fails—say, a SQL query misses a `JOIN`—Rigobot highlights the exact line, explains the error, and suggests a solution, often tying it back to core concepts. It even reviews recent commits to catch bad habits, like hardcoding values, nudging you toward professional standards.

Rigobot’s feedback is personalized. It tracks your past mistakes (e.g., forgetting Python’s `self` in classes) and offers targeted tips to strengthen weak spots. With one click on [**LearnPack**](https://www.learnpack.co/)’s “Get Feedback” button, you’re chatting with Rigobot like a friend who’s a coding expert.

## Faster Learning, Better Results

Rigobot’s real-time feedback means you’ll never get stuck. Students breeze through [**4Geeks Academy**](https://4geeksacademy.com/)’s curriculum ([Full-Stack Development](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/part-time-full-stack-developer), [Data Science](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/datascience-machine-learning), or [Cybersecurity](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/cybersecurity)) finishing projects faster, with cleaner code, and a better understanding of best practices. This speed translates to confidence: you’re not just completing exercises, you’re mastering skills employers value.

Rigobot also tracks your progress through [**LearnPack**](https://www.learnpack.co/)’s built-in tests, giving you a clear view of your strengths and gaps. By catching errors early and explaining *why* they happen, it turns every mistake into a lesson, helping you build a standout portfolio.

Everything in the 4Geeks curriculum—HTML/CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, SQL, React, Flask, Django, Node.js, and Data-Science tools.

- **Do I need extra plugins?**

No. The LearnPack CLI + VS Code extension ships with Rigobot built in.

- **Will AI replace human mentors at 4Geeks?**

Never. Rigobot handles quick fixes, freeing instructors to dive deep into architecture, soft skills, and career coaching.
