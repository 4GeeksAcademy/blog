Education has always been a matter of “How to Pay?”, “Do I qualify?”, “Am I going to be accepted?”, and then, again, “How do I Pay that tuition?”

First things first, let’s answer your main question right away: How much does the program cost?

**Part-time: $7,499**
**Full-time: $9,499**

**No extra fees. No tricks.**

There are, normally, three ways to face that challenge:
(i) Scholarships (any kind);
(ii) Banking (or financial institutions) support; and,
(iii) Paying your own fees (self-funded).

However, we have designed a customized financial payment option just for this program.

We lowered the cost, and, yes, it was a big challenge, but we found a way to offer you a Premium Education with an unbeatable price.

Now there’s more: We do not only offer the best price in the city but also the best payment plan. Others will follow, but we know we are the first to offer you the Extended Payment Plan.

If you want to fully understand how the process works and what we mean by “Extended Payment Plan”, you can take a deeper look in our [Payment GuideBook](https://storage.googleapis.com/4geeks-academy-website/Material%20(PDF%20and%20Images)%20website/4GA%20Financial%20Guidebook.pdf)

We tried to answer every question you may have, but, most importantly, we have designed a program where coding is a priority and not pricing.

Check out your options on the chart below:

|                | Upfront       | 6 Months                           | 12 Months                          | 24 months                          |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| **Deposit**          | No deposit     | $1,500                             | $1,500                             | $1,500                             |
| **Instalments amount** | Collected before program start date or in thirds | $852.89                            | $444.24                            | $240.06                            |
| **Payment Schedule**   | Collected before program start date or in thirds | Every 30 days for 6 months from the start date. | Every 30 days for 12 months from the start date. | Every 30 days for 24 months from the start date. |
| **Total Payment**      | $7,499        | $5,117.34 + Deposit               | $5,330.88 + Deposit               | $5,761.44 + Deposit               |
| **Payment Method**     | Debit, Credit, Deposit, Wire Transfer or Zelle | Debit, Credit, Deposit, Wire Transfer or Zelle | Debit, Credit, Deposit, Wire Transfer or Zelle | Debit, Credit, Deposit, Wire Transfer or Zelle |

**Upfront Payment:** You can either pay in (1) one down payment; or, (2) split the upfront amount into thirds. If you choose “Pay in thirds”, the first 1/3 is due 15 days before the start date. The next 1/3 is due the very same day of the start date, and the last 1/3 is due 15 days after the start date.
