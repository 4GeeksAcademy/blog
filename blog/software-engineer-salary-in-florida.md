## Top Companies for Software Engineers

If you think you have what it takes, you can aim for a job in the biggest paying companies in the technology sector, like Google and Microsoft. Assuming that you want to know the top companies hiring for software engineer jobs, you can read [Glasdoor’s list on this matter](https://www.glassdoor.com/Explore/top-software-engineer-companies_IO.4,21.htm). But, we can at least give you the top five companies with the average salary.

| Company | Industry | Employee Rating | Salary |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Google | Internet & Web Services | 4.5 | 210,782 $/yr |

| Cisco Systems | Enterprise Software & Network Solutions | 4.3 | 183,688 $/yr |
| IBM | Information Technology Support Services | 4.1 | 136,420 $/yr |

These companies aim for innovation and the development of products, be they hardware or software. But, not all jobs are like this. There are a lot of jobs that focus on the maintenance of information systems, database administration, systems analysis, cybersecurity analysis, etc. 

There are also opportunities in the entertainment industry in areas like video game development, VFX development, etc. 

Of course, if you limit your job hunting to the state of Florida, you will find a reduced amount of job postings to work for the biggest companies. Given this, don’t scratch off working for smaller companies. As long as the salary and benefits are around the average, you will be fine. Although, it is useful to use [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) to check on the work culture and overall reputation of the possible companies that you will be working for, and determine if it's a good work environment for you.

Taking these opportunities will surely give you the headstart you need in a successful career as a software engineer.

## Where to Find Job Offers for Software Engineers

You can try finding jobs on a variety of job listing sites. The most popular ones are Linkedin, Indeed and Glassdoor. But you can also search on sites aimed specifically at software engineers, like Gun.io.

Another way is to go to look for job offers on the recruiting sites of the top companies. A good example of this is in the [Google job board](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/) site. Here you can find job postings aimed at entry-level applicants. You can also gain access to job postings if you earn a Google Career Certificate.

## Getting a Job as Software Engineer in Florida

Now that you know where to find jobs and how much they pay, how can you get your perfect job? This depends on whether this is your first job out of college or just your next step in your professional career. If you are a recent graduate or someone without any experience in the field, you need to step up your skills in different areas:

- Verbal and written communication
- Problem-solving skills
- Programming languages
- Ability to work with a team
- Technical skills

You can show proficiency in these areas by obtaining certificates that relate to the area that you are aiming for, making projects that show your skills, participating in coding competitions, and working on your portfolio. Remember, knowing what you can offer to your employer is the first step to finding a job with a good salary.

On the more demanding, and better-paying, job opportunities it’s common that the applicants are asked to code a simple program within certain parameters. This way the interviewers can see your style of coding, problem-solving skills, and overall knowledge. An example of a common test is the FizzBuzz problem, where you have to design a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, it has to print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". Lastly, for numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it has to print "FizzBuzz".
