# Software Engineer Salary in Florida

Getting a job as a software engineer in the current industry can be seen as a daunting task at first, but knowing how to better your chances of having a high-paying job is more simple than you think. Even then, deciding on your first job, or even just changing jobs, you need to have all the information you need. Given this, we have compiled some of what you need to know to land the best job you can get.

How much a software engineer makes in Florida, depends on various factors like place of employment, experience, and responsibilities, among others. According to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/florida-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IS3318_KO8,25.htm), the average salary for a software engineer in Florida sits around 94,398 $/yr. But taking into account the years of experience, we can pinpoint more precisely the salary that you should be aiming for. 

For an entry-level job the average salary sits around 84,221 $/yr, for 4 to 6 years of experience it’s around 97,955 $/yr and for more than 10 years of experience, it’s around 111,372 $/yr and up, according to [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/florida-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IS3318_KO8,25.htm).

## Industry Growth

[The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm) predicts a raise of 15% in overall employment in computer and information technology from 2021 to 2031. Certainly good news for any software engineer looking for work. Given this, not every job will be a good fit for you. Be prepared to compromise on some things like time of commute and job expectations, so you can make the optimal choice when the opportunity arises. 

## Balancing Benefits and Software Engineer Salary in Florida

Even though a job position could pay more than average, you have to remember that in the current market, salary is not the be-all and end-all. Currently, the benefits offered by employers have become a big point of discussion in job interviews. In the current state of affairs, having good health insurance can be the difference between a normal life and going bankrupt. Taking this into account when job hunting is essential for anyone. 

Taking this advice into practice can mean that sometimes you will need to compromise a higher salary, in exchange for better benefits. For example, you are presented with two job opportunities, one offers above average salary and a simple benefits package while the other offer pays below average salary but has a really good benefits package. Depending on your objectives you could choose either. 

Knowing the importance of benefits you may wonder what type of benefits are offered. In the accompanying list, you will see some of the benefits that will be offered to you:

- Healthcare insurance
- Retirement savings
- Paid time off
- Vacation time
- Remote work
- Career development

## Top Companies for Software Engineers

If you think you have what it takes, you can aim for a job in the biggest paying companies in the technology sector, like Google and Microsoft. Assuming that you want to know the top companies hiring for software engineer jobs, you can read [Glasdoor’s list on this matter](https://www.glassdoor.com/Explore/top-software-engineer-companies_IO.4,21.htm). But, we can at least give you the top five companies with the average salary.

| Company | Industry | Employee Rating | Salary |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Google | Internet & Web Services | 4.5 | [210,782 $/yr][link4] |
| Microsoft | Computer Hardware Development | 4.2 | [190,195 $/yr][link5] |
| Apple | Computer Hardware Development | 4.2 | [196,345 $/yr][link6] |
| Cisco Systems | Enterprise Software & Network Solutions | 4.3 | [183,688 $/yr][link7] |
| IBM | Information Technology Support Services | 4.1 | [136,420 $/yr][link8] |

These companies aim for innovation and the development of products, be they hardware or software. But, not all jobs are like this. There are a lot of jobs that focus on the maintenance of information systems, database administration, systems analysis, cybersecurity analysis, etc. 

There are also opportunities in the entertainment industry in areas like video game development, VFX development, etc. 

Of course, if you limit your job hunting to the state of Florida, you will find a reduced amount of job postings to work for the biggest companies. Given this, don’t scratch off working for smaller companies. As long as the salary and benefits are around the average, you will be fine. Although, it is useful to use [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) to check on the work culture and overall reputation of the possible companies that you will be working for, and determine if it's a good work environment for you.  

## Where to Find Job Offers

You can try finding jobs on a variety of job listing sites. The most popular ones are [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/), [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/?from=gnav-homepage) and [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm). But you can also search on sites aimed specifically at software engineers, like [Gun.io](https://gun.io/).

Another way is to go to look for job offers on the recruiting sites of the top companies. A good example of this is in the [Google job board](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/) site. Here you can find job postings aimed at entry-level applicants. You can also gain access to job postings if you earn a Google Career Certificate.

## Getting the Job

Now that you know where to find jobs and how much they pay, how can you get your perfect job? This depends on whether this is your first job out of college or just your next step in your professional career. If you are a recent graduate or someone without any experience in the field, you need to step up your skills in different areas:

- Verbal and written communication
- Problem-solving skills
- Programming languages
- Ability to work with a team
- Technical skills

You can show proficiency in these areas by obtaining certificates that relate to the area that you are aiming for, making projects that show your skills, participating in coding competitions, and working on your portfolio. Remember, knowing what you can offer to your employer is the first step to finding a job with a good salary.

On the more demanding, and better-paying, job opportunities it’s common that the applicants are asked to code a simple program within certain parameters. This way the interviewers can see your style of coding, problem-solving skills, and overall knowledge. An example of a common test is the FizzBuzz problem, where you have to design a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, it has to print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". Lastly, for numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it has to print "FizzBuzz".
