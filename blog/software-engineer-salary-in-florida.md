But you can also search on sites aimed specifically at software engineers, like [Gun.io](https://gun.io/).

## Getting a Job as Software Engineer in Florida

Now that you know where to find jobs and how much they pay, how can you get your perfect job? This depends on whether this is your first job out of college or just your next step in your professional career. If you are a recent graduate or someone without any experience in the field, you need to step up your skills in different areas:

- Verbal and written communication
- Problem-solving skills
- Programming languages
- Ability to work with a team
- Technical skills

You can show proficiency in these areas by obtaining certificates that relate to the area that you are aiming for, making projects that show your skills, participating in coding competitions, and working on your portfolio. Remember, knowing what you can offer to your employer is the first step to finding a job with a good salary.

On the more demanding, and better-paying, job opportunities it’s common that the applicants are asked to code a simple program within certain parameters. This way the interviewers can see your style of coding, problem-solving skills, and overall knowledge. An example of a common test is the FizzBuzz problem, where you have to design a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, it has to print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". Lastly, for numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it has to print "FizzBuzz".
