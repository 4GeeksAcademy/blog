At 4Geeks Academy we have two main goals with our students:

First, train them by providing a premium coding education: enable our students to become software developers with a strong professional profile.

And, second: incorporate them into the developers’ community with networking, hiring partners and personal branding opportunities.

That is why we are so pleased to announce that we have partnered with the startup technology and marketing studio [**Launch Potato**](https://launchpotato.com/) : which means unlimited career opportunities working with an amazing, fun and energetic team distributed across the US, Europe, and Asia.


## Knowing a little more about Launch Potato


Launch Potato is a profitable startup studio that incubates and scales mobile and web companies.  Created by four founders with expertise in technology, Launch Potato is a team of innovators and creators, passionate about their work and the world at large.  Its diverse global team has a shared passion for development, digital marketing, and scalable technologies.

They’re headquartered in the heart of downtown Delray Beach on Atlantic Avenue, but they also have an amazing, distributed global team.  Launch Potato believes in building teams who can solve complex problems using smart marketing, great engineering, data science, and fun!  They were recently named the #5 Fastest Growing Technology Company by South Florida Business Journal and have a 5-star rating on Glassdoor.com.


## How can you get your career opportunity with Launch Potato?


We have been working on designing a customized and job-oriented process to give our students the opportunity to grow not only as software developers (skills learned in the program thinking about the market open positions) but also with a broadened career/profession approach.  Our team work towards addressing these four pillars:



 	
  1. Partnership with [Career Score:](https://www.careerscore.com) Focused on telling the appropriate story to employers.  This 2017 we consolidated a partnership that will enable our students to get the profile and build the strength that potential employers are seeking to fulfill.

 	
  2. Individual coaching sessions with our Career Support Department, where we work towards your personal concerns.  These sessions are about: technology strengths, language barriers, what kind of jobs are more likely to appear, where they should be located, fields of work, hours per week, etc.

 	
  3. Ensuring a working Student-Teacher relationship by having our mentors involved with each individual student approach, and help them overpass their tech weaknesses, as well as working within an environment of deadlines, challenges, and peer programming.

 	
  4. Building a personal and customized profile for each student, where every detail is built and worked towards improving their profile.  This profile is then sent to our partners according to what they are looking for and for whom we believe will make the best match.


We ensure that the profiles sent to our partners are really close to what they are already looking for.  Despite the tech training - which is granted in 4Geeks Academy because we constantly deliver a premium coding education and we keep improving and enhancing our academic content and platform to offer more exercises and projects (over 750 so far) to our students - we also work on attaining the coding soft skills required in a Dev/Tech team.
