4Geeks Academy is thrilled to announce our partnership with BITE-CON with a series of monthly tech education events happening at our Brickell campus. BITE-CON’s mission to spread awareness about innovative technologies aligns perfectly with 4Geeks’ goal of making cutting-edge skills accessible to diverse communities.

Our first joint event on June 22, “BITE-CON Series: Leveraging Blockchain for Social Impact” featured Nandy Martin, the chairman of Captain Haiti Foundation, to discuss how blockchain has already begun uplifting Miami’s Little Haiti neighborhood. Thanks to Martin’s work, Captain Haiti Foundation recently raised an extraordinary $5 million to support Little Haiti against the threat of gentrification. At the event, Martin shared insights into how blockchain made this possible through the creation of LittleHaitiCoin and a partnership with Dargent Group.

4Geeks Academy is committed to being part of Miami’s tech ecosystem and empowering communities often left out of the innovation conversation. Our partnership with BITE-CON is one of the many ways we're working to spread opportunity. 4Geeks students, staff, and the broader community will have the chance to learn about breakthrough technologies and connect with pioneers leveraging them for social good.

So far, 4Geeks has produced over 4,000 graduates with an 84% job placement rate. We work to make tech education accessible to people of color and other underrepresented groups, opening doors to high-paying and high-growth careers with a variety of online and in-person courses, such as the Full Stack Developer Course.

The future is here, and it’s being built with emerging innovations like blockchain. But for new technologies to truly transform lives, the opportunities they enable must be available to all. 4Geeks and BITE-CON have joined forces to spread understanding of innovations like blockchain and connect communities with their possibilities. This recurring event series will feature talks on Web 3.0, NFTs, the Metaverse, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and eSports to the Black and Brown community

We hope you will join 4Geeks and BITE-CON in our shared mission of empowering communities through education. Don't miss out on this game-changing discussion! Captain Haiti is sure to get your head spinning with ideas.
