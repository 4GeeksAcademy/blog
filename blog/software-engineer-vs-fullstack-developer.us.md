## What is a full stack developer?
![source: https://codequotient.com/blog/scope-of-full-stack-developer-india/](https://codequotient.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/What-does-it-take-to-be-a-Full-Stack-Developer.jpg)

A **full stack developer** is responsible for building, testing, maintaining and managing a web platform in all its aspects, this means both the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is all the content that can be seen on the screen, that is, texts, photos, forms, videos, colors and everything that has direct interaction with the user.
On the other hand, the back-end is the part of the platform that is behind, that is, the management of the databases that this page stores, authentication system, password management, data saving, etc ...Although they are different areas, generally performed by people with different backgrounds using different technological tools, and different techniques, with the great growth that the web world has had in the last 15 years began this career of full-stack, an expert developer in both areas. 

## What is a Software Engineer?
Software engineers design and develop computer programs and applications. Strong demand for skilled software engineers means that professionals can pursue many employment options in various industries.
Computer software engineers create computer programs and operating systems. They collaborate with system programmers, analysts, and other engineers to design systems, projects, and performance interfaces.

Computer software engineers also analyze user needs, provide design consultation, and coordinate software installation. Engineers must consider mathematical models and scientific analysis to project outcomes when designing software systems.

### What is Software Engineering?
The field of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications is known as software engineering. Software engineers use engineering principles and programming language knowledge to create software solutions for end users.

> "The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity, not to create it."

## Differences in most used technologies.

ðŸ’» As a **software developer**, you will create software to assist in the resolution of real-world problems. This necessitates a combination of technical knowledge and strong communication abilities. If you want to pursue this as a career, here are some skills you should work on developing:

+ Programming languages like Python, Java, C, C++, and Scala. Many of them are also used in back-end development.
+ Database design Object-oriented programming, for example, Flask library is very used in this field.
+ Scrum and Agile project management
+ Computer operating systems
+ The cloud computing
+ Version management
+ Debugging and design testing

+ MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Firebase, and Cassandra: are database language and tools.
+ Web servers include Apache, Nginx, and IIS.
+ DevOps tools include Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure.
+ Mocha, Chai, Jest, Selenium, Protractor, Postman, and Visual Studio Code are examples of testing and debugging tools.

Anyway, in any technology area is common to use one of the most powerfull tools since nowadays: git.

GIT is a Version Control System that allows to a teamwork to share in a very organized way every little advance, and in this way create more and more complex and interesting project. If you want to read mor about git and github [click here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git).

It should be noted that the specific technologies and tools used will vary depending on the project requirements, team preferences, and other factors.
