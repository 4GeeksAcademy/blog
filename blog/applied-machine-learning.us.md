# Applied Machine Learning

Tech is growing, which means we will be welcoming a lot of new disciplines, and Applied Machine Learning is one of them. Applied Machine Learning is the field of AI that helps create teaching systems that can learn from information and data provided to them. Astonishing, right? But it's only the beginning! This means that systems will be able to improve their own, and programmers won't have to write new codes. It wouldn't be wrong to say that it's pretty efficient and will become a thriving field for programmers. So, if you are an enthusiast, we are reviewing the Applied [Machine Learning Course](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/machine-learning-engineering) by 4Geeks Academy!


## What Is The Applied Machine Learning Course?
This course is a perfect choice for programmers interested in learning Google Data Studio, [Python](https://4geeks.com/technology/python), Statistics, and Streamlit. It’s because knowing how to analyze the data is the important part (wouldn’t be wrong to call it the foundational step). By the end of this course, you will be to create your predictive models with the help of Numpy, Pandas, and Python.

The course teaches you advanced algorithms, and you have to option to choose between self-paced or supervised learning. In addition to teaching the basics, they teach you how to use industry-standard tools because they give practical knowledge. The Applied AI Machine Learning course spans over 16 weeks, and you only have three classes a week (it leaves enough time to practice and party) and thime is enough for you to become a Top [Machine Learning Engineer](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/machine-learning-engineer/machine-learning-engineer).

The best part is the class size, it doesn’t go beyond 12 people, so every student gets due attention. The course is available in Spanish and English, but if you go to the campus, the language depends on the country you are attending to, they have multiple campus around the world, like per example the [coding bootcamp in Miami](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-campus/coding-bootcamp-miami) or their [Coding Bootcamp in Berlin](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-campus/coding-bootcamp-berlin-germany). They allocate two weeks to learn Python, two weeks for fundamentals, two weeks for collection, and three weeks for cleaning.

In addition, there are four weeks where you learn how to create a model and a week to learn the deployment. The last two weeks are for the final project. If you want to know what all these weeks entail, check out these details:

### Python
This is for dipping your toes into the coding world because you get to learn the basics of algorithms and Python. Also, you will learn how to create the model training in ML and AI.

### Fundamentals
These two weeks are all about learning linear algebra and statistics. In addition, you will learn the core trends, mean, median, mode, and standard deviation. They give you real-life challenges, which makes learning more interactive and exciting.

### Collect
As the name suggests, you will learn how to collect the data by connecting yourself to an SQL database. In addition, you will learn how to use SQL Syntax to manipulate the files.

### Clean
These three weeks are about understanding our data. You will learn a lot of visualization techniques to optimize and clean your data. Also, you will learn how to create reports with filters and graphs.

### Model
Here comes the fun part, where you get to work with practical ML. You will be given different scenarios, and you’ve to solve them all with Python, ranging from Time Series to Lineal Regression, Decision Trees to Bayes, and more.

### Deploy
This one week will be exciting because you will get to create an AI strategy and launch an ML development and deployment lifecycle. 

You will love deploying the Machine Learning strategies, we promise (did we mention that you can work on cloud infrastructures, too?). After all this, you get two weeks for a final project, where you can select some real-life problems and leverage your Applied AI Machine Learning knowledge to build an entire infrastructure on your own; exciting!

## In person Machine Learning Course

Now that you know how exciting the course is, you must be wondering about the campuses. Well, there are online sessions available with self-paced lectures and one-on-one mentoring. However, if you want to go on the campus, there are [campuses in Toronto](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-campus/coding-bootcamp-toronto-canada), Orlando, and Miami. In case you are in Europe, you can take on-campus classes in Madrid, Barcelona, Malaga, Valencia, Lisbon, Munich, Dublin, Berlin, Roma, Milan, and more.

What we love about 4Geeks Academy is that there are on-campus sessions available in Latam, including Venezuela, Chile, Bolivia, Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Argentina, Panama and Uruguay.

Don’t we all feel lost at some point in our careers? Well, with 4Geeks Academy, that’s not a problem. This is because everyone who joins the boot camp will get an instant membership, so you can get a mentor and lifetime support.  There is also [GeekForce](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/geekforce-career-support), with which their graduates get employment coaching (yup, you will be taught how to land a job with 401k!).

The pricing of the course is different, depending on your location, so you can go on their website, select the learning type (part-time or full-time), and select the location. However, if the fee is too much, you can pay in installments or sign up for a scholarship to go free.

The bottom line is that Applied Machine Learning in Python is pretty great, and 4Geeks Academy is doing a great job teaching an in-demand skill. In fact, 84% of their graduates get a job in tech within 90 days of graduating, which is a great number, especially when unemployment is on the rise. So, we say this place is a great option!
 
 ## What Is 4Geeks Academy?
First things first, you need to know about the academy you are joining, right? This is a licensed platform and is considered one of the best, and results-driven bootcamps out there.Once you join [4Geeks Academy](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/datascience-machine-learning) to learn coding, you get lifetime career support, quick response time if you have any questions, and one-on-one mentoring (did we mention it’s unlimited?).
