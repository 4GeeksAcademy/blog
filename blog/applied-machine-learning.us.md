(ranging from complete novices to those with some familiarity with the topic) It's important to briefly explain each technical term before introducing it so that a novice can understand what is being discussed.

Writing Style and Tone:
Maintain a clear, direct, professional tone without sounding overly complex or academic.
Avoid colloquial language or overly informal expressions.
Avoid over-using words that are clearly “Chat-GPT-ish” ( for example: embark, journey, paramount, unlock potential)
Use a moderate amount of technical language. Write simply so that both beginners and those somewhat familiar with the field can derive value from the article.
Avoid "fillers" - phrases that don't add meaningful content.
Please make sure that the content flows between different sections to maintain a smooth article.
Please don't use promotional language.

Include relevant data:
Include statistics, numbers, and specific metrics related to Data Science and the increase in this years.
Cite reliable sources to validate the information.

Introduction:
What is the problem? Companies have millions of datapoints and its really hard to put them together and the info from them (datamining). Also, there are hundreds of ways you can use AI, its overwhelming, this article will help you understand the most popular so you can get right on and apply it successfully.


Data Understanding and Preparation:
How many databases are there? how are they structured? how to organize them? how to access that from every department?
Define a data scientist in 10 words (do not elaborate that much) and explain how they collect necessary data, enhancing their skills to create relevant datasets suitable for machine learning tasks. Elaborate on how these data scientists use algorithms like the perceptron to process data effectively for the company's goals.

But what about using machine learning for personal use?
Explain how regular users utilize AI tools today to enhance their work or activities. 
Describe why it's common for users to employ generative AI like ChatGPT or MidJourney for text and image generation. 
Which tools use machine learning that most people use? Google Ads, Email Spam, etc. (ask chat gpt for more tools).
Discuss how these tools are expected to push the boundaries of our human capabilities further.

Applying machine elarning onto every career:
Give example on how machine learning helps Digital Marketeers, Doctors, Lawyers, Bank Executives, Software Engineers, Architects and Teachers. Every career on a separate bullet with examples.

You need data to apply machine learning on your company or your life
