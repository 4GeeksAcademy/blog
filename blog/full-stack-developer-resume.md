A strong portfolio is a key factor in landing a job as a [Full Stack Developer](https://4geeksacademy.com/es/coding-bootcamps/full-stack-part-time). According to recent data, having a well-crafted portfolio can increase the chances of being hired by as much as 40%. This is because a portfolio showcases a developer's skills, experience, and work samples, providing potential employers with a tangible understanding of their abilities. So, if you're a Full Stack Developer looking to boost your hiring prospects, be sure to put in the time and effort to create a compelling portfolio that highlights your skills and experience.

## Importance of a portfolio for a  Full Stack Developer

In addition to the full stack developer resume (or CV), where a job applicant can show their academic achievements, titles that support their learning, experience in previous companies, etc, a portfolio is a self build tool, where the developer can show and expose his completed works. It does not focus on educational titles or jobs previous experience, but on showing, with evidence, what the developer can really do.

In this sense, there are professionals who opt for developing a personal website, others create a repository in the cloud, make infographics or there are even professionals who create a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/4GeeksAcademy) to show their projects or share live how they develop a facet of their professional life. The limit is the imagination and the format is up to you.

A good piece of advice before starting to plan a portfolio is to know that it must speak for itself, that the employer at the moment of entering the page is quickly convinced that the applicant is very capable and knows what he is doing. It will be the letter of introduction, that is, it doesn't matter if you have a great academic background, if you are not capable of making a consistent code that you can show, then you have to review that.

## Elements of a Strong Full Stack Developer Portfolio

As we mentioned earlier, the portfolio should speak for itself and be consistent. Here we leave you some tips for a good portfolio and certain things that cannot be missing for a strong portfolio.

- Curriculum vitae

Although in the world of technology, titles and experience are not the most important thing, as in other fields, it is always good to have a solid and well-presented CV, because a good resume also speaks of your good professionalism.

- Contact information

Obviously, like any presentation element, contact details cannot be missing, they are essential for the employer to reach and contact you.

- Repository or link to it

Although it may sound a bit technical, in the world of technology development a repository is a daily occurrence. A repository is an element, generally online, where many people can work simultaneously to put together a larger project.

- Training certificates

Just like those offered by [4Geeks Academy](www.4geeksacademy.com), the training courses, although they do not speak of your net ability, do certify certain training and instruction in a certain subject, that is why we call them certifications and they are also material that, if you have them, cannot be missing in your portfolio. It is an important part of your presentation.

## Important skills to show on a Full Stack Developer Portfolio

Because full stack development includes both, [Front End Development](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-front-end-development) and [Back End Development](https://4geeks.com/lesson/backend-developer), it is necessary for a portfolio to demonstrate proficiency in both areas. If you do not have experience, you can still expose the languages and tools that you learned in the course(s) that you have taken in your learning, whether they are paid or free.

Mention which frameworks you are familiar with, which ones you use and what you managed to do with that knowledge. This with both disciplines (front and back). The largest frameworks and tools for developers are easy to find in the study plans of certain academies where a learning line is built to cover the entire Full Stack spectrum. At 4Geeks Academy, a Bootcamp-type program is offered where in 6 months anyone without previous experience is prepared, from zero to junior developer, giving the student a vital development tool-box to deploy in a compelling portfolio.

## Tips for Building an Effective Full Stack Developer Portfolio

So, we already know what should go in a good portfolio, characteristics that it should have, and where to acquire those skills that all employers around the world are looking for in their future workers. Now, when putting your hands on the keyboard, we give you some tips that will be very useful:

- Focus on your main projects

It is not good to fill with content, put unimportant projects that do not make you proud. It is always better to expose well finished projects paying special attention to the quality and elegance of the code. The content must have a good presence and be very professional, which is why it is counterproductive to expose too many projects that are unfinished or have bad practices.

- Quality is better than quantity

Your portfolio should reflect your level of knowledge and be consistent with your professional profile. For example, if you are looking for a job and you have some experience in projects using some programming language, like javaScript, focus on putting in this type of experience and don't enlarge your range of knowledge.

- Inexperience in not is a limiting factor

If you do not have experience, you can also have a portfolio. In it may be practices of your formative period, personal projects, including participating in the improvement of projects such as OpenSource, contributing your improvements through Pull Request in the repository.
