One of the main concerns for those trying to join a Coding Program is how to pay the tuition costs.  The answer to this question may vary, but we have a simple path to recommend.

Since 4Geeks Academy is delivering programs through an alliance with Miami Dade College, the Tuition Fee for that program is already a bargain: $3,405!  A top-quality program with that Tuition Fee does not exist.  Take it!!!

However, the Department of Education of MDC has come with payments options, such as:

  1. If you are an early bird (enrolling at least 6 weeks before each program), you will be paying only $2,995.

 	
  2. If you want to split the payment, you can try and request a two-installment option. You will need to [contact us](mailto:admissions@4geeksacademy.com) in order to get the offer from the system.


Of course, you can still apply for a bank loan.  There are plenty of third-party options to help you out.  If you are concerned about some of them, ask us and we will try to help you!

**Other options**

Another option you could explore is the IRS [Employer Education Assistance program](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15b/ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink1000193755).  This program consists of your employer supporting your education by paying for your tuition and deducting this from their annual tax report.  We recommend you talk to your employer regarding this option as both parties benefit from it.

Family loans are a good option, too, for those who count on their relatives’ support.

If null of these options are appealing to you, and, you have either a private loan or another financing option that we have not explored in this article, please feel free to contact us at:
