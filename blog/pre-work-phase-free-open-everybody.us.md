Do you want to become a developer? You have 3 choices: College, a bootcamp or learning by yourself. But how to decide? You don't even know if you are going to be a good developer, maybe it's not for you at all. That's why we think it's only fair to let you test it out first.

We are like the US Open for bootcamps. We don't have coding interviews, we don't ask for a pedigree, previous coding experience or any credentials. Anyone can enroll and take the pre-work.

You are probably asking yourself why? Here's the inside scoop:



 	
  1. It's an opportunity for students to try out the course, write their first lines of code, create their first website and see if coding is for them.

 	
  2. We want to know our students, and it's impossible to really get to know someone in 2 or 3 meetings. The interview process for a bootcamp is pretty much like a job interview. Applicants know what to say in order to please the recruiter, that's why the recruiter needs to work hard to have access to the candidate's real personality and thoughts. In the end, you won't know until after they start working.

 	
  3. We confess, at the end it's also a business decision: If we give away free trials of our product, more people will sign up, and less people will keep researching other options. Once a student attends pre-work, chances are high that they'll like the product and will want to continue on to the class phase of the bootcamp.


Our pre-work is remote and online, so you can do the lessons and exercises when it best fits your schedule. All we ask is that you finish the whole 2 weeks without quitting.

In pre-work you will learn: HTML5, CSS and some Javascript. There will be some webinars and also QA sessions with one of our mentors.

All that said, if you're interested in coding, we really encourage you to take the 2 weeks of free pre-work. We only ask for a very small (US $160) deposit to seal your commitment. You'll have it back if you finish the pre-work and don't want to continue to the next phase.
