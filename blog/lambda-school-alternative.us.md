If you're researching coding bootcamps in 2025, you’ve probably come across BloomTech—formerly known as Lambda School. Once one of the most talked-about programs in tech education, it’s now equally searched for another reason: people are actively looking for alternatives, after growing criticism around disputed job placement claims and confusing financing.

Whether you're switching careers or finally diving into tech, here’s why **a growing number of students are choosing 4Geeks Academy instead**—and how our **transparent outcomes, lifelong mentorship, and job guarantee** set us apart.

## What Happened to Lambda School / BloomTech?

Once a pioneer in the ISA (Income Share Agreement) model, **BloomTech** (formerly Lambda School) has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years. After **multiple staff layoffs**, the school paused new cohorts and now only lists a waitlist for upcoming courses. In 2024, the U.S. **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** found its ISA program lacked transparency and reclassified it as a loan, banning BloomTech from offering it. Meanwhile, **internal data leaks** revealed that its actual 6-month job placement rates were closer to **50%**, well below the previously advertised 86%, further undermining confidence in the school.

- **Mass Layoffs:** Four rounds of cuts culminated in a 50 % staff reduction; full-time instructors were let go.
- **Loan Crack-Down:** In 2024 the **CFPB enforcement action** proved BloomTech’s “risk-free ISA” was really a loan, banned the company from lending, and forced refunds.
- **Program on Hold:** As of mid-2025 BloomTech lists only a wait-list for “future AI courses” and runs a self-paced MOOC with limited live support.
- **Placement Reality Check:** Internal data leaked in 2023 showed *≈50 %* of grads hired within six months—far below the 86 % once advertised.
