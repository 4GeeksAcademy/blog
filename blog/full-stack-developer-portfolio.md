A portfolio is a self built tool designed to showcase your completed projects. It is not focused on educational titles, jobs, or previous experience but on providing evidence of what you can do as a developer.

Do not confuse the portfolio with the resume: The [full stack developer](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/full-stack-developer/full-stack-developer) resume (or CV) is the place to list academic achievements, certifications and diplomas that prove your qualifications, experience in previous companies, etc.

## The format and layout of a developer portfolio

There are professionals who choose to develop a personal website, others create a repository in the cloud or make infographics. There are even professionals who create a YouTube channel to exhibit their projects and share their knowledge and skills. Your imagination is the limit and the format is up to you.

> If you want to be a front end developer, the layout and UI/UX of your portfolio must be great!

A good piece of advice for your portfolio is that it must speak for itself. When the potential employer visits your page they should **immediately get a sense of your level of capability and knowledge**. Your portfolio is your letter of introduction. In the world of coding, it doesn't matter if you have or don't have a great academic background; you need to be a good coder and be able to show it.

## Elements of a Strong Full Stack Developer Portfolio

Here is a list of elements that are essential to include in a strong portfolio, plus a few extra tips.

+ **Personal projects**: Publish one slide for each project, explaining what the project is about and how it works. Include screenshots, explain the architecture and engineering challenges, etc. Make sure to provide a link to a live demo (recommended) or github repository.

+ **Resume**: Although in the world of technology, titles and formal experience are not the most important thing, it is always a good idea to have a solid and well-presented resume that will speak for a high level of professionalism.

+ **Contact information**: Ensure your contact details are included and easy to find. They are essential for the employer to be able to reach you.

+ **Github or Gitlab repository URL's**: Although it may sound a bit technical, in the world of technology working with a Github or Gitlab repository is a daily occurrence. A repository is an online storage space that allows people to work on projects colaboratively.

+ **Training certificates**: Just like those offered by [4Geeks Academy](https://4geeksacademy.com/), any training or courses you have taken provides evidence of a certain grade of knowledge and instruction. Although they do not reveal your real abilities, they are an important part of your background and should definitely be included in your portfolio.


### Important skills to show on a Full Stack Developer Portfolio

Because full stack development includes both, front-end and back-end, it is necessary for a portfolio to demonstrate proficiency in both areas. If you do not have experience, you can still expose the languages ​​and tools that you learned in the course(s) that you have taken in your learning, whether they are paid or free.

Mention which frameworks you are familiar with, which ones you use and what you managed to do with that knowledge. This with both disciplines (front and back).
