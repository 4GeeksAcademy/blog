A portfolio is a self build tool, where you can show and expose your completed projects and works. It does not focus on educational titles or jobs previous experience, but on showing, with evidence, what the developer can really do.

Do not confuse the portfolio with the resume: The full stack developer resume (or CV) is the place to showcase academic achievements, certifications and diplomas that support your learning, experience in previous companies, etc.

## The format and layout for a developer portfolio

There are professionals who opt for developing a personal website, others create a repository in the cloud, make infographics or there are even professionals who create a YouTube channel to show their projects or share live how they develop a facet of their professional life. The limit is the imagination and the format is up to you.

> If you want to be a front end developer portfolio, the layout and UI/UX must be great!

A good piece of advice before starting to plan a portfolio is to know that it must speak for itself, that the employer at the moment of entering the page is quickly convinced that the applicant is very capable and knows what he is doing. It will be the letter of introduction, that is, it doesn't matter if you have a great academic background, if you are not capable of making a consistent code that you can show, then you have to review that.

## Elements of a Strong Full Stack Developer Portfolio

As we mentioned earlier, the portfolio should speak for itself and be consistent. Here we leave you some tips for a good portfolio and certain things that cannot be missing for a strong portfolio.

+ **Personal projects**: Publish one post for each project in which you can explain what the project does, show screenshots, explain the architecture and engineering challenges, etc. Make sure to point people to a live demo (recomended) or github repostiory.

+ **Curriculum vitae**:Although in the world of technology, titles and experience are not the most important thing, as in other fields, it is always good to have a solid and well-presented CV, because a good resume also speaks of your good professionalism.

+ **Contact information**: Obviously, like any presentation element, contact details cannot be missing, they are essential for the employer to reach and contact you.

+ **Github or Gitlab repository URL's**: Although it may sound a bit technical, in the world of technology development a repository is a daily occurrence. A repository is an element, generally online, where many people can work simultaneously to put together a larger project.

+ **Training certificates**: Just like those offered by [4Geeks Academy](https://4geeksacademy.com/), the training courses, although they do not speak of your net ability, do certify certain training and instruction in a certain subject, that is why we call them certifications and they are also material that, if you have them, cannot be missing in your portfolio. It is an important part of your presentation.


### Important skills to show on a Full Stack Developer Portfolio

Because full stack development includes both, front-end and back-end, it is necessary for a portfolio to demonstrate proficiency in both areas. If you do not have experience, you can still expose the languages ​​and tools that you learned in the course(s) that you have taken in your learning, whether they are paid or free.

Mention which frameworks you are familiar with, which ones you use and what you managed to do with that knowledge. This with both disciplines (front and back). The largest frameworks and tools for developers are easy to find in the study plans of certain coding academies built to cover the entire Full Stack spectrum like this [full stack coding bootcamp](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/part-time-full-stack-developer) program.


### Tips for Building an Effective Full Stack Developer Portfolio

We already know what should go in a good portfolio, characteristics that it should have, and where to acquire those skills that all employers around the world are looking for in their future workers. Now, when putting your hands on the keyboard, we give you some tips that will be very useful:

#### Focus on your main projects

It is not good to fill with content, put unimportant projects that do not make you proud. It is always better to expose well finished projects paying special attention to the quality and elegance of the code. The content must have a good presence and be very professional, which is why it is counterproductive to expose too many projects that are unfinished or have bad practices.

#### Quality is better than quantity

Your portfolio should reflect your level of knowledge and be consistent with your professional profile. For example, if you are looking for a job and you have some experience in projects using some programming language, like [JavaScript](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript), focus on putting in this type of experience and don't enlarge your range of knowledge.

#### Inexperience in not is a limiting factor

If you do not have experience, you can also have a portfolio. In it may be practices of your formative period, personal projects, including participating in the improvement of projects such as OpenSource, contributing your improvements through Pull Request in the repository.

## Full Stack Developer vs Software Engineer portfolio

Software Engineers are seen as a more capable version of the full stack developer, with better architectural and abstraction skills, if you are software engineer, I recommend following a different strategy.

If you are looking for a [software engineer portfolio](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/software-engineer/software-engineer-portfolio), make sure to checkout this article.

If you can certify yourself as a software engineer, we recommend enrolling in our [software engineer bootcamps](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/software-engineer-bootcamp).

## What is and what does a full stack developer do?

A [full stack developer](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/part-time-full-stack-developer) is who works both on the front-end as in the back-end of a website or application, that is to say: it is both, in the part of the users and of the server. These kinds of developers must handle all those aspects that improve the user experience to create intuitive and fast interfaces, such as the layout of the elements, menus, urls, etc. To do this, you will need to combine good design with creativity and functionality along with front-end discipline, that is, handling all the information flow from the server and database that make it possible for a web application to work how it is supposed to. Therefore, the [back-end work developer](https://4geeks.com/lesson/backend-developer) must have knowledge of programming languages.

The full stack developer must know how to work with computer logic and handle abstract concepts and work with the user's intuition and empathize with the genuine use of the web page, master style, aesthetics, functionality, balance, performance, usefulness, composition, efficiency, etc...

The objectives and functions of a front-end developer and of the [back-end developer](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-front-end-development) are different but complementary. The shape of a full stack developer I would assume both roles having a complete vision of a project/business. It is for this reason that within the technological profiles, that of the full stack developer is one of the most demanded at present and, according to the projection, it will continue to be so in the near future, being reflected in the incomes.
