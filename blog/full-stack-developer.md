## What is a Full Stack Developer?

A full stack developer is responsible for building, testing, maintaining and managing a web platform in all its aspects, this means both the Front End and the Back End. The Front End is all the content that can be seen on the screen, that is, texts, photos, forms, videos, colors and everything that has direct interaction with the user, on the other hand, the Back End is the part of the platform that is behind, that is, the management of the databases that this page stores, authentication system, password management, data saving, etc. 

Although they are different areas, generally performed by people with different backgrounds using different technological tools, and different techniques, with the great growth that the web world has had in the last 15 years began this career of Full Stack, an expert developer in both areas.

>The full stack developer is the person in charge of build, develop, maintain and manage the whole stuff, the Front End, with all the design of the website in charge of been friendly, attractive and cool, and the other side, the Back End.

Even though they are different disciplines from each other and therefore it can be thought that developer profiles are different from each other, with the growth of digitalization in the last 10 years, the demand for [Front End](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-front-end-development) and [Back End developers](https://4geeks.com/lesson/backend-developer) has increased by 135% leaving many companies without enough people to carry out the projects. Due this increase on the demand of Full Stack Developers many bootcamps and universities has launched [Full Stack developer courses](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/part-time-full-stack-developer) that can be done online or face to face. Consequently, a new discipline arises that combines both, all developed by a single person, we call it Full Stack developer. With this explanation it is easy to define a Full Stack developer as a developer (or engineer) who can build, maintain and work with both the Front End and the Back End of a website. Since Full Stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.

A Full Stack developer can work in-house (remotely) or at a computer development company that engineers websites, software, and other components for other businesses. This is one of the great advantages of this job, the freedom to physically work from wherever you want, often with flexible hours and good salaries.

Full stack developers are very often confused with Software Engineers, if you want to learn more about this you can check this article about the [differences between a Full Stack Developer and a Software Engineer](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/full-stack-developer/full-stack-developer-vs-software-engineer).

## Skills and Responsibilities of a Full Stack Developer

Because a Full Stack developer works with several disciplines, it is necessary that they have knowledge and know how to work with several programming languages. A very important skill for the Front End is the ability to work in a team, because generally the design of the website that the user sees (also called UI) is not made by a Full Stack developer, but by a UX/UI designer, an expert in aesthetics, user intuition when using the page and the order of the items.

Some of the responsibilities of a full stack developer are:

+ **Developing** and, after that, **maintaining** the server-side and client-side components of the web site.

+ **Integrating** the server-side and client-side components of a web application: This involves writing code to ensure that the server-side and client-side components communicate effectively with each other.

+ **Testing and debugging** 🐞: Full stack developers are responsible for ensuring that their code works as it is supposed to, detecting bugs, errors and different kinds of problems. Testing pages is a whole area in development so there are very skilled people working on it, but it is important to be able to manage the basic part of it.

+ **Staying up-to-date** with industry trends and best practices: Full Stack developers need to keep abreast of the latest technologies, programming languages, frameworks, and tools in order to ensure that they are using the most effective and efficient solutions for their projects. This is important also because the SEO of a web page is much better if it's built with good practices.

## Common Technologies Used by Full Stack Developers

The most used languages for Front End development are HTML, CSS and [JavaScript](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript). The latter, unlike the other 2, is a programming language, that is, it can be programmed with, while HTML and CSS are simply code to build something visible, but it does not interact with the user, it does not work. with variables or functions. Within the Javascript world there are many frameworks, or work structures, that using this language facilitate the development of complex platforms in the easiest way possible. Some of these are VueJS, Angular, and React. For the Back End, languages are generally used to manage databases, such as SQL (the most used), and for all the rest Java, PHP, Ruby and Python.

Full stack developers work with a range of technologies across the Front End and Back End of a web application or platform. Here are some common technologies used by full stack developers:

### 🖥 Front End Technologies:

For creating the structure and visual styling of web pages the most used language is **HTML** and [**CSS**](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-css-learn-css). They both work together, the first one in the structure and the second one for the design, colors, fonts and the rest of variables.

After that for creating interactive and dynamic web pages **JavaScript** is the third ingredient, as well as for developing front-end frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.

There are also front-end frameworks and libraries, these tools help a lot to get a nice result of the development using popular front-end frameworks and libraries include **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**, and **Bootstrap**.


### 🖥 Back End Technologies:

Server-side languages: Common server-side languages used by full stack developers include **Java**, **Python**, **Ruby**, **[Node.js](https://4geeks.com/lesson/introduction-to-node-js)**, and **PHP**.

Web servers: Common web servers used in full stack development include **Apache** and **Nginx**.

Databases: Full stack developers work with a variety of databases, including **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **Oracle**, and **PostgreSQL**. It is important to mention that there are basically 2 types of databases, relational (SQL) and non-relational (non-SQL).

APIs: Full stack developers often create and work with **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow different software systems to communicate with each other. An API is a little program used as an intermediary between a server and a user. Data and information can be requested and it responds to be able to use that data.

## Full Stack Developer Resume and Job Application

+ **Key Elements of a Strong Full Stack Developer Resume**: There are 2 very used tools in the tech industry to show your skills and previous works to a company for a job position.

+ **Full Stack Developer Portfolio**: The other great tool widely used in these cases is the portfolio. A portfolio is basically a web page where the applicant can physically and specifically demonstrate the projects they have developed by putting links to said pages (if they are not their own), and creating a good experience for the person who will enter said web page. That is where all the creativity of the developer can be embodied.
