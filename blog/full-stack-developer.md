## What is a Full Stack Developer?

A full-stack developer is responsible for building, testing, maintaining, and managing a web platform in all aspects, meaning both the **Front End** and **Back End**. The **Front End** includes everything visible on the screen‚Äîtext, images, forms, videos, colors, and anything that interacts directly with the user. On the other hand, the **Back End** is the hidden part of the platform, handling the database, authentication systems, password management, data storage, and more.

Though these are different areas, they are typically handled by separate professionals with diverse backgrounds using various tools and techniques. With the incredible growth of the web over the last 15 years, the **Full Stack Developer** role emerged‚Äîa developer skilled in both areas.

> The Full Stack Developer is the person in charge of building, developing, maintaining, and managing everything: the **Front End**, ensuring the website is user-friendly, attractive, and cool, and the **Back End**.

Despite being distinct disciplines‚Äîand thus one might assume developers in these roles have different profiles‚Äîthe digital boom of the last decade has increased demand for [Front End](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/what-is-front-end-development-es) and [Back End developers](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/backend-developer-es) by **135%**, leaving many companies short-staffed for projects. Due to this surge in demand for Full Stack Developers, many bootcamps and universities have launched [Full Stack Developer courses](https://4geeksacademy.com/es/coding-bootcamps/desarrollador-full-stack/) (available online or in-person). Consequently, a new discipline combining both areas emerged, handled by a single professional: the **Full Stack Developer**.

In simple terms, a Full Stack Developer (or engineer) can build, maintain, and work on both the **Front End** and **Back End** of a website. Since they are involved in all aspects of development, they must have expertise in both.

A Full Stack Developer can work remotely (from home) or at a software development company designing websites, software, and other components for businesses. This is one of the biggest advantages of this career: the **freedom to work from anywhere**, often with flexible hours and competitive salaries.

Full Stack Developers are often confused with **Software Engineers**. To learn more, check out this article on the [differences between a Full Stack Developer and a Software Engineer](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/full-stack-developer/full-stack-developer-vs-software-engineer).

## Skills and Responsibilities of a Full Stack Developer

Some key responsibilities of a Full Stack Developer include:

- **Developing** and **maintaining** both server-side (Back End) and client-side (Front End) components of a website.
- **Integrating** Front End and Back End components: This involves writing code to ensure seamless communication between the two.
