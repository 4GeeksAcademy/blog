## Machine Learning Course Syllabus: Basic Python
The foundation of our [machine learning bootcamp](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/machine-learning-engineering) begins with pre-work in basic Python, laying the groundwork for students to build their programming proficiency. Python, known for its simplicity and versatility, is the backbone of data science and machine learning. Through this pre-work, students gain fluency in Python programming, enabling them to tackle more advanced concepts with confidence.

## Foundations of Machine Learning
The course syllabus delves into foundational topics such as data collection, storage, and manipulation. These fundamental skills are essential for any aspiring data scientist or machine learning practitioner. Students learn how to gather data from various sources, organize it efficiently, and perform essential manipulations to prepare it for analysis. This hands-on experience with real-world datasets provides practical insights into the challenges and nuances of working with data in a professional setting.

### Core Python Libraries
Python's rich ecosystem of libraries is a key feature of our machine learning course syllabus. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib make data manipulation and visualization easy. Pandas helps organize and analyze data, NumPy simplifies numerical computations, and Matplotlib enables the creation of various types of charts for data visualization. By mastering these libraries, students gain valuable skills directly applicable to real-world data science projects.

### Mathematical Fundamentals
Understanding basic math concepts is crucial in data science. Concepts such as linear algebra, probability theory, and calculus are essential for understanding the underlying principles of machine learning algorithms. Students develop a solid understanding of these mathematical concepts, enabling them to tackle more advanced machine learning topics with confidence. Key concepts covered include matrices, vectors, and relationships between variables, applied using Python for practical exercises.

### Data Acquisition and Storage
Data acquisition and storage are essential elements of the applied machine learning workflow. Our course equips students with the necessary tools and techniques to manage data in diverse formats and from various origins. Students learn the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data into their pipelines using Python, particularly in handling databases like SQL and manipulating common file types such as CSV and JSON. Techniques like web scraping for efficient data gathering from websites are also covered.

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Our machine learning bootcamp covers both supervised and unsupervised learning, each with its own set of techniques and algorithms. In supervised learning, models are trained using labeled data, meaning the input data is paired with the correct output. In contrast, unsupervised learning finds patterns and relationships in unlabeled data without predefined labels. The syllabus includes learning about algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, with practical implementation using Python. Advanced neural networks for tasks like image recognition and language understanding are also explored.

### Real-World Project
The capstone project serves as the culmination of the machine learning bootcamp. Students apply their skills to a real-world problem by gathering and analyzing data and developing and evaluating the appropriate machine learning models. This project-based approach provides valuable experience in all aspects of the applied machine learning workflow, from data collection and preprocessing to model selection and evaluation, ensuring that students are well-prepared to tackle the challenges they'll encounter in their future careers.
