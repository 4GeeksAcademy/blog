To begin, we need to know in what area we are going to specialize in, or what the language is being used by the business or organization.  In this article we are going to talk about the three most used languages in the last two years, which are: PHP, Python and Ruby.

First of all, let’s review some concepts:

**PHP: **is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.  PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management system and web frameworks.

**RUBY: **is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language.  Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun - following the principles of good user interface design.

**PYTHON: **is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.  Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.  Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles.

For example, here are some sites built with:

**PHP: **Wikipedia, Udemy, Facebook.

**RUBY: **Twitter, Hulu, Groupon.

**PYTHON: **YouTube, Google.

If we talk about usability, we can observe that PHP follows a classic approach and is extensively documented - this means that it is in the middle of the scale.  Ruby is highly usable because of its principle of least astonishment - enforcing to minimize confusion for users - placing it in a better position on the scale than PHP.  Python uses strict indentation enforcements and it is the most readable programming language, which means that, on the scale, Python and Ruby fight for the best position.

In the case of "ease of learning," PHP is slightly above half of the scale.  Ruby is slightly below half of the scale, and Python is the best of the scale.

Now, let’s take a look on the index made by _Tiobe_._com_:

_The TIOBE Programming Community_ index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages; in this index we´re going to compare May 2016 and May 2015.

As we can see, Python has climbed in one year from six to five; PHP from nine to six, and Ruby has climbed from 15 to eight.  That means that these three languages are very competitive between them.

However, PHP is still being the language more often used to program because hosting is supported by almost every provider out there and there´s also a huge community of open-source projects that use it.

Python and Ruby are the newest ones compared to PHP; they also have an elegant and easier language than PHP does.

If we take a glimpse into some "job-hunter" companies in the Miami area, we find the following:

It seems that PHP was not a leading language amount the Miami organizations, but if we combine the _Tiobe_ research with the job hunters company in Miami, we find that PHP was climbing faster than the other languages, and it looks like it will be one of the top languages required by Miami businesses.
