## Definition of Full Stack Development

In the world of web development, the [full stack developer](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/part-time-full-stack-developer) is the person in charge of building, developing, managing and maintaining both parts of the page or platform. Both parts implies the front-end part and the back-end part. But what does each of these parts mean?

The [front-end](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-front-end-development), as its name says, is everything that the user has direct interaction with and can see on the screen, including photos, texts, videos, colors, navigation bars, links, etc. The front-end is the part of the website that makes the usability of the site possible for anyone who accesses it. When entering a page and entering a username and password, (fields that we call forms), by pressing "Log in" we send these texts to "somewhere" where it is verified that that username and password match an existing user, and in If it is correct, it allows the user to enter their account. All this process that the user does not see is what we call back-end.

Back-end corresponds to all the code built that makes user requests interact (from the front-end) with the server where the page is hosted and the databases that it may have associated. The definition of backend in techterms, a very prestigious page dedicated to educating people in terms of technology and development, says the following:

> "The "backend" refers to any part of a website or software program that users do not see. It contrasts with the frontend, which refers to a program's or website's user interface. In programming terminology, the backend is the "data access layer," while the frontend is the "presentation layer."

> "Most modern websites are dynamic, meaning webpage content is generated on-the-fly. A dynamic page contains one or more scripts that run on the web server each time the page anguis accessed. These scripts generate the content of the page, which is sent to the user's web browser. Everything that happens before the page is displayed in a web browser is part of the backend."

##  Understanding the Skills and Technologies Required for Full Stack Development

The front-end and back-end development of a web platform has different tools and technologies associated with it, and the skills required for the proper development of each part are different. Since full stack development brings together both disciplines in the same person, it requires the developer to handle the technologies, knowledge, and skills that both parties demand.

Broadly speaking, the development of the front-end requires the management of design skills, UX (user experience) and logical order so that the use of the website is as intuitive and friendly as possible. Aesthetic and tidy rendering and a responsive (different size of screen devices image adapting) page are some of the skills that cannot fail in front-end development. Even the correct understanding of the interaction with some APIs (Application Programming Interface) and the use of such data from that interaction.

On the other hand, the [back-end](https://4geeks.com/lesson/backend-developer) involves within its needs different skills. Among them are the management of databases (relational and non-relational), authentication systems for users (through tokens or others) and the interaction with the front-end to send certain information it requires.

Given the difference between the two disciplines, programming languages, frameworks and tools are different for the development of one or the other. Below is explained how each of the most common skills necessary for the development of each of these areas are specifically acquired.

In addition to all the skills mentioned there are others such as software architecture, specialty in hardware and cybersecurity, but we will not talk about these topics in this article.

## Developing the Required Skills for Full Stack Development

Some of the different disciplines that the Full Stack Development requires assuming languages and frameworks are:

### Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
<div style="text-align:center;">

![required-skills-to-become-a-full-stack-developer](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJ2mIAWYUh7psGZTotv1lBEW9D_N-RGJm0oePHXBmtCw&s)
</div>

**HTML** means "Hypertext Markup Language", is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web (www) pages. Nowdays isn't a good practice to define color, fonts or esthetic attributes in this part of the webpage, just the texts and organizational structure of the content.

A html works like this:

```
<!-- this is how a html file content looks like -->

<html>
  <head>
    <title>4Geeks Academy</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>4Geeks Blog</h1>
    <h2>This is a secondary title</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.4geeksacademy.com">The best blog in the web</a> is that can help you to your developing learning path.
    </p>
    <h2>This is ANOTHER secondary title</h2>
    <p>
      Some text over here will give out webpage a lot of information.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

As we can see, there is no details of colors or backgrounds in this file, just the structure of the content. After having the correct structure or the content of a webpage a new file will give all the visual and esthetic attributes to all of the blocks of content that we defined in the html file. This new file will use the ".css" extension in its name and only with this 2 tools you will get a professional look to your website.

Only with this 2 tools you can get a very beautiful and creative design for your website, but there is something that you won't have, interaction with the user and dynamism. It will be a static and lifeless webpage, but when you introduce some programming language, like javascript you will have a section of code that can be run in response to an event or when a certain need is satisfied.

JavaScript functions are used to carry out specific tasks like validating user input, changing a webpage's content, or reacting to user input like keystrokes or mouse clicks.

### Learning a Front-End Framework

Front-end frameworks are JavaScript libraries that include Bootstrap and CSS that let you build websites, online applications, and mobile apps. As web development progresses, front end frameworks make it far simpler for developers to create the awesome user interfaces of their web and mobile applications. All the wen choices and platforms nowadays are more complex than before, and very day more, so with these tools developers can handle and sort all the different files that a big project needs.

Some of the most popular front-end frameworks are:

+ [Angular](https://angular.io/)

> Angular is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at **Google** and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

<div align="center">

</div>


+ [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

> Free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by **Meta** and a community of individual developers and companies.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2699/PNG/512/reactjs_logo_icon_170805.png">
</div>

+ [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)

> An open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in several projects, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.

### Learning a Back-End Language and Framework

As we explained above, if javascript gives dynamism to a static page, back-end programming languages handle all the data and databases that give operational stability to the website. Some of the most popular languages for back-end development are [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [Java](), [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and the most used nowadays is [Python](https://www.python.org/). Every existing framework has been written with some of those programming languages, so is this language that the developer must use to work in each framework.

Some of the most popular front-end frameworks are:

+ [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

> The most popular Python framework used in web development. Based on the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle, Django focuses on code reusing, thus enhancing the development speed. It is also a very secure framework.
>Being a Python framework, Django is very user-friendly and easy to learn. It’s also one of the most popular full-stack frameworks and provides a lot of functionality out-of-box like REST API support.

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/django-11-1175036.png">
</div>

+ [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)

> PHP is one of the most used programming languages in backend development. Laravel is a PHP framework that is based on MVC architecture. It is a beginner-friendly framework that has a user-friendly interface, extensive library, and brilliant API support. Using Laravel simplifies the backend development while building modern secure web applications. This is especially true if you are working on non-trivial applications.

    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/665938876293324800/Fl2b_czt_400x400.png">
</div>

+ [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)

> Flask is another python framework that you can use for backend development. It is regarded as a microframework because it omits the use of specific tools and libraries. Moreover, there is no database abstraction layer, form validation, or external source dependency. It’s a simple, highly flexible, and performing web framework. Being a lightweight framework, or micro-framework, it is easy to learn and understand Flask. Moreover, being a Python framework, it is very user-friendly.

### Learning Database Management Skills

What is a database? Oracle, the company that develops the Oracle browser, define a database like:

> A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database. Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

IBM, one of the most prestigious companies of technology in the world define in its webpage SQL database like:

> SQL, which stands for “Structured Query Language,” is the programming language that’s been widely used in managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS) since the 1970s. In the early years, when storage was expensive, SQL databases focused on reducing data duplication.

> NoSQL is a non-relational database, meaning it allows different structures than a SQL database (not rows and columns) and more flexibility to use a format that best fits the data. The term “NoSQL” was not coined until the early 2000s. It doesn’t mean the systems don’t use SQL, as NoSQL databases do sometimes support some SQL commands. More accurately, “NoSQL” is sometimes defined as “not only SQL.”

Database management has many associated languages, many widely used, others less, but all respond to one or the other of the two types of databases that exist; SQL or NoSQL. So what's the difference? SQL and NoSQL vary depending on whether they're relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL), whether their schemas are predetermined or dynamic, how they scale, the kind of data they support, and whether multi-row transactions or unstructured data are a better fit. The program of the **full stack development** course of [4Geeks Academy]( https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/part-time-full-stack-developer) offers within the back end section management of SQL databases with the Python language. Although this language is not specialized for this type of data, it contains very good and complete libraries for good back-end database management, such as [sqlAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). In just 6 months it prepares you to have a basic management of databases and to be able to find job opportunities for this type of work.


### Learning API Development and Integration Skills

Is very probable that you have heard talk about amazon, the biggest online shop in the world present in almost all countries. They have also a service called AWS, (Amazon Web Services) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Often times, clients will use this in combination with autoscaling. In their blog they give the following definition:

> APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.

Basically, an API is a small program through which a user can interact with a database or a particular server. Each API has been programmed by a **back-end developer** or by a **[full stack developer](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamps/part-time-full-stack-developer)** and to interact with it you must write the correct format that each request that is made must have.
