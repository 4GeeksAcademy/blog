Here's what's happening in the market, and more importantly, how you can thrive in it.

Let's be honest: the road to your first (or next) tech job in 2025 isn't going to be easy. There's a lot of competition, the market is evolving quickly, and not every opportunity is what it seems. But here's the good news:

**For every challenge, there's a strategy.**

**For every obstacle, there are still plenty of opportunities.**

Whether you're a recent bootcamp grad, a self-taught developer, or transitioning from another industry, **this is not the time to give up.** This is the time to be **intentional, visible and proactive.**

And yes, AI is not magically taking away your chances. You got it.

## Feeling like job hunting in tech is hard? Let me tell you, it doesn't have to be.

### Here are 4 ways to stand out and move forward:

#### 1. Build Your Personal Brand

Let people see your journey: post about your learning process, snippets of your projects, reflections on wins and mistakes, and show your curiosity and determination.  
Platforms like **GitHub** and **LinkedIn** are excellent for gaining visibility. Just a few posts can help the right person notice you at the right time.

#### 2. Apply Beyond the Popular Job Boards

With the rise of online learning, more people than ever are entering the tech world.  
This means that job postings, especially for junior roles, can receive hundreds of applications. But don't be discouraged: **many companies are still hiring**, and they're looking for people who show initiative, not just degrees.

That said, it's essential to go beyond Indeed and LinkedIn. While these platforms are useful, **everyone is applying there**, which means more competition.

Visit the career pages of companies you admire, join their talent communities, and apply directly. You can even find employees on LinkedIn and send them a personalized message, especially when you're genuinely excited about the role.

#### 3. Get Creative About Gaining Experience

Gaining experience is key after learning a new skill. But it doesn't have to come only from professional jobs.

Many listings ask for experience, even for "entry-level" roles, but **experience can take many forms**: personal projects, open-source contributions, freelance work, volunteering for a nonprofit, doing job simulations, or even building your own app or tool.

If you've built something, solved a problem, or worked with others, you **do have experience**.

You just need to learn how to present it effectively.

#### 4. Network with Intention (and Kindness)

**One connection today can turn into an offer tomorrow.**

Networking isn't just for extroverts, it's a powerful tool to learn about the market, discover hidden opportunities, and grow through others' experiences.

Connect with people in roles you aspire to, recruiters in your field, alumni from your school or bootcamp, or employees at companies you admire.

And don't just hit "Connect"---**start a conversation, ask questions, share a kind message.**

You're planting seeds that can grow into an opportunity tomorrow... or even next week.

## The Truth? There Are Tech Jobs, and You Can Get One

People are getting hired every day, and many started right where you are now.

What makes the difference? **Not just gaining new skills, but making them visible, along with effort and perseverance.**

You don't have to be perfect. You just have to keep going. And when you do, you get better, more confident, and more hireable.

The job hunt can feel uncertain, but you're building something bigger than a job, you're building a career.  
The skills you develop today, the people you connect with, and the confidence you build will lead you to the opportunities you've been dreaming of.

**Keep sharing your journey. Keep learning. Keep building.**

Your future in tech isn't just possible, it's waiting for you.
