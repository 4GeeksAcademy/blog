# 4GeeksAcademy partners with Co.Lab

After the completion of a structured program like a [coding bootcamp](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamp) like 4GeeksAcademy, it can be difficult for graduates to stay consistent in continuing to further their programming portfolio on their own. Standing out among peers is also a challenge, which impacts confidence during the job search. The catch-22 of needing a job to get a job is especially real for junior tech talent and those pivoting from other careers. 

4Geeks Academy [coding bootcamp in miami](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-campus/coding-bootcamp-miami) has partnered with Co.Lab to tackle this issue head-first.

## Simulating Real-World Tech Environment

Co.Lab tackles this issue with a fully remote, part-time, 8-week long [software development bootcamp](https://www.joincolab.io/software-development-bootcamp) that simulates a real, professional tech environment following their own 4-step plan. Students work in cross-functional teams to build products, along with the guidance of an industry mentor. They are matched into a team with a product manager, designer, and another developer, and work together to ship a real product. Co.Lab allows graduates to gain interdisciplinary team experience, which is a significant benefit in the industry.

## Benefits for Students

Co.Lab focuses on helping bootcamp graduates gain real-world tech experience, become job-ready, and keep up momentum. Graduates will speed up their job search, with 85% of Co.Lab participants landing roles within 3 months of graduation. Co.Lab provides structure and continuous accountability in a supportive environment for students, allowing them to keep up momentum. Co.Lab also helps graduates build confidence in their unique skills, highlighting their value when job searching.

## How does the partnership benefits our graduates?

4GeeksAcademy graduates can get a guaranteed spot in Co.Lab’s program, following their graduation from the bootcamp. Students will also get access to additional perks and community resources as part of their Co.Lab experience. 

**Ernesto Gonzalez** was one of our graduates that joined Co.Lab’s program: “At Co.Lab I was able to experience an environment similar to that of an actual work environment. It was an amazing opportunity to work with another developer, a product manager, and a designer on an actual product. This team work experience was invaluable for someone like me who was just starting in the field.”
