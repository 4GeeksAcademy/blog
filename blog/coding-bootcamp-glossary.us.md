If you are considering enrolling in a coding bootcamp, you may encounter unfamiliar terms. Understanding these key terms will help you navigate your learning journey and maximize your bootcamp experience. This glossary includes common terms used in coding bootcamps and the tech industry to help you get started.

### Coding Bootcamp

A coding bootcamp is an intensive, short-term training program that teaches coding and software development skills. These bootcamps focus on practical skills that can be directly applied in the workplace, usually over a few months. Bootcamps offer a fast-track way to launch a career in tech, often without needing a traditional four-year degree.

### Full-Stack Development

Full-stack development refers to the ability to work on both the front-end and back-end of web applications. The front-end involves everything the user sees and interacts with on a website, while the back-end deals with the server, database, and application logic. Full-stack developers are proficient in both areas and can build complete web applications from start to finish.

### Frontend vs. Backend

- **Frontend**: The part of a website or application that users interact with directly. This includes elements like buttons, menus, and layout. Frontend developers use technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create user interfaces.

- **Backend**: The part of a website or application that users donâ€™t see. It involves the server, database, and application logic. Backend developers work with languages like Python, Ruby, or Node.js to manage how the application works behind the scenes.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language used primarily for creating interactive effects and dynamic website functionality. It is one of the core languages used in web development, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript is a must-learn language for anyone pursuing a career in web development.

### Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and automation. Python is popular for beginners due to its simple syntax and powerful capabilities.

### Data Science

Data science involves the extraction of meaningful insights from large amounts of data. It combines programming, statistical analysis, and domain knowledge to help organizations make data-driven decisions. Bootcamps focused on data science teach skills such as data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

### Machine Learning (ML)

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms to analyze data, learn from it, and make predictions or decisions. It is commonly used in applications like recommendation systems, predictive analytics, and self-driving cars.

### API (Application Programming Interface)

An API, or Application Programming interface, is a collection of protocols and tools that enables different software systems to interact and share information. It gives developers the ability to tap into data or functionality from external platforms and seamlessly incorporate those capabilities into their own applications. For example, many websites use APIs to integrate Google Maps or payment systems like PayPal.

### GitHub

GitHub is a platform for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to store and manage their code in repositories. GitHub makes it easy for developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and contribute to open-source software.

### Agile Methodology

Agile is a project management methodology used in software development that focuses on delivering small, incremental improvements over time. It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and continuous feedback from customers.
