Accessible and affordable educational financing
**[Income Share Agreements](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/financials)** (ISAs) provide an enticing financing option for higher education. ISAs align the incentives of the educational institution with your career and future, **removing the economic barriers to the educational system and quality employment**. You won't pay interest or much of the principal **until you get a job** and generate income with a minimum salary.

Relief from financial burdens while in-school: ISAs **allow students to focus on their studies without worrying about student debt.**
It is a payment commitment conditional on employment success. If everything goes well, you’ll start making affordable repayments **(max. 15% of your income)**; High-quality education: 4Geeks and Quotanda partner with the **Inter-American Development Bank** to offer high-quality courses.
