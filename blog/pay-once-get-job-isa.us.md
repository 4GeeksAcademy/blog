# **Pay once you get a Job**




## Income Sharing Agreement at 4Geeks Academy


**Full Disclosure:** We are no longer offering ISA's in our USA campuses, and ISA's are limited in a few countries only. 

We have accepted and worked with ISA's (Income Sharing Agreement) for many years. And we still do offer them in a few places. The main idea behind the ISA approach is to offer the possibility to join one of Bootcamps, graduate, focus on your skills, and then get a new job. You will only need to start paying your tuition once you land a Job above $35,000 per year (pre-tax). 

Coding Education has become an important asset for those who are willing (i) to change careers; (ii) launch a new startup; (iii) undertake new projects; or (iv) enhancing their ongoing careers with new skills. However, the tuition fee has been a burden for those who are committed to Learn To Code but does not have the resources to undertake such a commitment. Education shall not be a matter of How Much, but a matter of How committed you are. 

The ISA payment option is still offered to full-time students under certain conditions and in certain locations. Student must meet with a few background checks: previous knowledge, background experience, time commitment, interest and goals to find an immediate job in Coding. 

It’s not only about finding a job, but it’s also about finding the right path. The ISA program launched by 4Geeks has let our students waive their tuition until you find a job with the option to start payments only if that position is offering them at least $35k per year. If it’s less, there is still no payment commitment. It’s about you, your career and the way education shall work.

At 4Geeks we are serious about building a new framework on education. The whole structure (including ISA's) of our programs is set to follow the same vision: allow people with the commitment and desire to change their life with coding and technology, achieve their dreams with us! Here is a brief description of how it works:

Our Full-Time program is meant for those who are putting everything at stake in order to achieve a career in Coding. Our Career Support team will be helping you throughout the program and after classes are completed. After finishing your 9 weeks immersed in Coding, our team will work together with you towards having everything ready for your new Career.

The Admissions process is pretty straight forward. Everything begins with your [application here](/us/landing/income-sharing-agreement), and then our Admissions Department will schedule an interview with us. After the interview, we will let you know if you are a candidate to get the benefits of our ISA program. The next step is about you completing the Pre-Bootcamp course (Pre-work) and the test included as part of your application. If everything works out accordingly, you will need to fill out the paperwork (Enrollment Agreement and ISA documentation) in order to complete your admission to the program. And that’s it, you will be enrolled and enjoy the benefits of becoming a software developer and pay only once you land a job over $35k (per year). 

If you want to get more info about 4Geeks, our programs and how the ISA works, please get in contact with us. We are always ready to help you throughout the process. 

**Final disclaimer**: Let me take a minute to state my most updated input about ISA's. This is based in my experience over the years working with hundreds of people joining our programs in multiple countries. 

ISA's are a tool that was well thought and it made sense a years ago as an option for many interested people, because the understanding was that if you were looking to transition careers, needed a push and were helped with ISA's, then ISA's are a perfect solution to focus on your coding skills first, and then on payments, only if success was achieved (a high paying job after). 

However, in our experience, people saw ISA's as an excuse to not pay, try the program, and if at some point, even after graduating, they did not end up liking it, or was too hard, or they found obstacles along the way (which always happens because you are learning something new and you also have a life at the same time) or if they thought that maybe coding was not for them, then they do not make payments, never complete the following steps, and never committed to payments. The route of a successfull ISA student requires commitments, hustling, passions and perseverence. Normally those are qualities that we have not encounter in the majorioty of our students joining throguh and ISA. It happens the same to when you give a 100% scholarship to a student.

The higher droput rate that we have ever had was always students enrolled through an ISA. There is not real skin in the game and allows to quit and not be committed, while the high committed people doing ISA's end up paying more (normally is at least 1.5 the revenue cap) than what could have happened if they joined using a straign and fixed payment plan or loan.
