# Blogposts

This repository contains all the blogposts published in the 4geeksacademy.com blogs section: https://4geeksacademy.com/us/blog

Here we'll upload all the files with the content of each post that will be published in the blog.

## How to add a new post?

In order to add a new post to the website, you have to follow the next steps:

1. Fork this repository to create a copy but yours.

2. Create a markdown file (`.md` file extension) in the `blog` folder.

    + The name of the file should be a slug that only includes letters, numbers and `-`. Do not include spaces, uppercase letters or other characters. i.e.: `welcome-to-4geeks.md`.

    + If you want to publish a post in other language, add the language abreviation at the end of the name, right before the file extension. i.e.: This a post in spanish `bienvenido-a-4geeks.es.md`.

2. Add your changes to your repository (`git add .`, `git commit -m "A message describing your contribution"` and `git push`).

3. Create a pull request in GitHub.

That's it! Then we'll review your changes and hopefully accept it soon!
